bequest of a particular thing, or money specified and distinguished from all

bequest of some particular thing in the testator's possession at that time, if
such a thing should be in the testator's possession at the time of his death.

sometimes given, with an executory limitation after the death of the tenant for
life to another person; in this case, the tenant for life is entitled to the
possession of the legacy, but when it is of specific article's, the first
legatee must sign and deliver to the second, an inventory of the chattels
expressing that they are in his custody for life only, and that afterwards they
are to be delivered and remain to the use and benefit of the second legatee. 3

quo ipso usu consumuntur, is a gift of the property, and that there cannot be a
limitation over, after a life interest in such articles. 3 Meriv. 194.</span></p>

cannot be a remainder in the strict sense of the word, and therefore every
future bequest of personal property, whether it be preceded or not by any
particular bequest, or limited on a certain or uncertain event, is an executory
bequest, and falls under the rules by which that mode of limitation is
regulated. Fearne, Cont. R. 401, n. An executory bequest cannot be prevented or
destroyed by any alteration whatsoever, in the estate, out of which, or after,
which it is limited. Id. 421; 8 Co. 96, a; 10 Co. 476. And this privilege of
executory bequests, which exempts them from being barred or destroyed, is the
foundation of an invariable rule, that the event on which an interest of this

in being, and twenty-one years, and the fraction of another year, allowing for
the period of gestation afterwards. Fearne, Cont. R. 431.</span></p>

The executor is not obliged to pay them sooner although the testator may have
directed them to be discharged within six months after his death, because the
law allows the executor one year from the demise of the testator, to ascertain

the statute of distributions is adopted, not only to ascertain the persons who

person described be not related to him in equal degree, those most remote can
only claim per stirpes, or in right of those who would have been entitled under

always supposes an inequality in relationship. For example, where a testator
