perhaps been enforced for many years somebody objects to its operation against
himself -- I mean his client.&nbsp; The President, if he approves it, begins to
execute it at once.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>LUNARIAN:&nbsp;

Not yet -- at least not in their character of constables.&nbsp; Generally

But this system of maintaining an expensive judicial machinery to pass upon the
