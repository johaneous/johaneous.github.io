<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Notice</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>. () With respect to the
necessity for giving notice, says Mr. Chitty, 1 Pr. 496, the rules of law are
most evidently founded on good sense and so as to accord with the intention of
the parties. The giving notice in certain cases obviously is in the nature of a
condition precedent to the right to call on the other party for the performance
of his engagement, whether his contract were express or implied. Thus, in the
familiar instance of bills of exchange and promissory notes, the implied
contract of an indorser is, that be will pay the bill or note, provided it be
not paid, on presentment at maturity, by the acceptor or maker, (being the
party primarily liable, and provided that he (the indorser) has due notice of
the dishonor, and without which be is discharged from all liability;
consequently, it is essential for the holder to be prepared to prove
affirmatively that such notice was given, or some facts dispensing with such
notice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Notice</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>. () Whenever the defendant's
liability to perform an act depends on another occurrence, which is best known
to the plaintiff, and of which the defendant is not legally bound to take
notice, the plaintiff must prove that due notice, was in fact given. So in
cases of insurances on ships, a notice of abandonment is frequently necessary
to enable the assured plaintiff. to proceed as for a total lose when something
remains to be saved, in relation to which, upon notice, the insurers might
themselves take their own measures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Notice</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>. () To avoid doubt or ambiguity
in the terms of the notice, it may be advisable to give it in writing, and to
preserve evidence of its delivery, as in the case of notices of the dishonor of
a bill.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Notice</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>. () The form of the notice may
be as subscribed, but it must necessarily vary in its terms according to the
circumstances of each case. So, in order to entitle a party to insist upon a
strict and exact performance of a contract on the fixed day for completing it,
and a fortiori to retain a deposit as forfeited, a reasonable notice must be
given of the intention to insist on a precise performance, or be will be considered
as having waived such strict right. So if a lessee or a purchaser be sued for
the recovery of the estate, and he have a remedy over against a third person,
upon a covenant for quiet enjoyment, it is expedient (although not absolutely
necessary) referring to such covenant.</span></p>
