hence, it denotes a right of precedence, or of doing certain acts, or enjoying
certain privileges, to the exclusion of others. It is the privilege of a member

Creditors of the same rank of privileges, are paid in concurrence, that is, on
an equal footing. Privileges may exist either in movables, or immovables, or
both at once. They are general or special, on certain movables. The debts which
are privileged on all the movables in general, are the following, which are
paid in this order. 1. Funeral charges. 2. Law charges, which are such as are
occasioned by the prosecution of a suit before the courts. But this name
applies more particularly to costs, which the party cast has to pay to the
party gaining the cause. It is in favor of these only that the law grants the
privilege. 3. Charges, of whatever nature, occasioned by the last sickness,
concurrently among those to whom they are due; see Last sickness. 4. The wages
of servants for the year past, and so much as is due for the current year. 5.
Supplies of provisions made to the debtor or his family during the last six
months, by retail dealers, such as bakers, butchers, grocers; and during the
last year by keepers of boarding houses and taverns. 6. The salaries of clerks,

workman or artisan for the price of his labor, on the movable which he has
repaired, or made, if the thing continues still in his possession. 2. That debt
on the pledge which is in the creditor's possession. 3. The carrier's charges
and accessory expenses on the thing carried. 4. The price due on movable
effects, if they are yet in the possession of the purchaser; and the like. See
Lien. </span></p>

without a credit. 2. Architects and undertakers, bricklayers and other workmen
employed in constructing, rebuilding or repairing houses, buildings, or making
other works on such houses, buildings, or works by them constructed, rebuilt or
