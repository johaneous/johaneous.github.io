These should be free and uninfluenced either by hope or fear. They are,
therefore, generally made by ballot, except those by persons in their
representative capacities, which are viva voce. And to render this freedom as
perfect as possible, electors are generally exempted from arrest in all cases,
except treason, felony, or breach of the peace, during their attendance on
election, and in going to and returning from them. And provisions are made by
law, in several states, to prevent the interference or appearance of the
military on the election ground. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Election</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'> (<i>n</i>.) One of the cardinal
principles on the subject of elections is, that the person who receives a majority
or plurality of votes is the person elected. Generally a plurality of the votes
of the electors present is sufficient; but in some states a majority of all the
votes is required. Each elector has one vote. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Election</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'> (<i>n</i>.) Elections by
corporations or companies are made by the members, in such a way its their
respective constitutions or charters direct. It is usual in these cases to vote
a greater or lesser number of votes in proportion as the voter has a greater or
less amount of the stock of the company or corporation, if such corporation or
company be a pecuniary institution. And the members are frequently permitted to
vote by proxy. See 7 John. 287; 9 John. 147; 5 Cowen, 426; 7 Cowen, 153; 8
Cowen, 387; 6 Wend. 509; 1 Wend. 98. </span></p>

things. 1. In contracts, when a; debtor is obliged, in an alternative
obligation, to do one of two things, as to pay one hundred dollars or deliver
one hundred bushels of wheat, he has the choice to do the one or the other,
until the time of payment; he has not the choice, however, to pay a part in
each. Poth. Obl. part 2, c. 3, art. 6, No. 247; 11 John. 59. Or, if a man sell
or agree to deliver one of two articles, as a horse or an ox, he has the
election till the time of delivery; it being a rule that &quot;in case an
election be given of two several things, always be, which is the first agent,
and which ought to do the first act, shall have the election.&quot; Co. Litt.
145, a; 7 John. 465; 2 Bibb, R. 171. On the failure of the person who has the
right to make his election in proper time, the right passes to the opposite
party. Co. Litt. 145, a; Viner, Abr. Election, B, C; Poth. Obl. No. 247; Bac.
Ab. h.t. B; 1 Desaus. 460; Hopk. R. 337. It is a maxim of law, that an election
once made and pleaded, the party is concluded, electio semel facta, et placitum
testatum, non patitur regressum. Co. Litt. 146; 11 John. 241.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Election</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'> (<i>n</i>.) Courts of equity
have adopted the principle, that a person shall not be permitted to claim under
any instrument, whether it be a deed or will, without giving full effect to it,
in every respect, so far as such person is concerned. This doctrine is called
into exercise when a testator gives what does not belong to him, but to some
other person, and gives, to that person some estate of his own; by virtue of
which gift a condition is implied, either that he shall part with his own
estate or shall not take the bounty. 9 Ves. 515; 10 Ves. 609; 13 Ves. 220. In
such a case, equity will not allow the first legatee to, insist upon that by which
he would deprive another legatee under the same will of the benefit to which he
would be entitled, if the first legatee permitted the whole will to operate,
and therefore compels him to make his election between his right independent of
the will, and the benefit under it. This principle of equity does not give the
disappointed legatee the right to detain the thing itself, but gives a right to
compensation out of something else. 2 Rop. Leg. 378, c. 23, s. 1. In order to
impose upon a party, claiming under a will, the obligation of making an
election, the intention of the testator must be expressed, or clearly implied
in the will itself, in two respects; first, to dispose of that which is not his
own; and, secondly, that the person taking the benefit under the will should,
take under the condition of giving effect thereto. 6 Dow. P. C. 179; 13 Ves.

importance. To enable the practitioner to make the best election, Mr. Chitty,
in his valuable Treatise on Pleadings, p. 207, et seq., has very ably examined
the subject, and given rules for forming a correct judgment; as his work is in
the hands of every member of the profession, a reference to it here is all that

phenomena associated with the accumulation or movement of electrically charged
particles within material bodies, classified as {static electricity} and
{electric current}. Static electricity is often observed in everyday life, when
it causes certain materials to cling together; when sufficient static charge is
accumulated, an electric current may pass through the air between two charged
bodies, and is observed as a visible spark; when the spark passes from a human
body to another object it may be felt as a mild to strong painful sensation.
Electricity in the form of electric current is put to many practical uses in
electrical and electronic devices. Lightning is also known to be a form of
electric current passing between clouds and the ground, or between two clouds.
Electric currents may produce heat, light, concussion, and often chemical
changes when passed between objects or through any imperfectly conducting
substance or space. Accumulation of electrical charge or generation of a
voltage differnce between two parts of a complex object may be caused by any of
a variety of disturbances of molecular equilibrium, whether from a chemical,
physical, or mechanical, cause. Electric current in metals and most other solid
coductors is carried by the movement of electrons from one part of the metal to
another. In ionic solutions and in semiconductors, other types of movement of
charged particles may be responsible for the observed electrical current.</span></p>
