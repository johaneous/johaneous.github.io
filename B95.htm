274,200 square kilometres (105,900&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and is surrounded by six
countries: Mali to the north; Niger to the east; Benin to the southeast; Togo
and Ghana to the south; and Ivory Coast to the southwest. Its capital is
Ouagadougou. In 2014 its population was estimated at just over
17.3&nbsp;million.[8] Burkina Faso is a francophone country, with French as an
official language of government and business. Formerly called the Republic of
Upper Volta (1958</span>–<span lang=EN-US>1984), the country was renamed
&quot;Burkina Faso&quot; on 4&nbsp;August 1984 by then-President Thomas
Sankara. The citizens of Burkina Faso are known as Burkinab</span>é<span
lang=EN-US>.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>The
northwestern part of present-day Burkina Faso was populated by hunter-gatherers
from 14000 BC to 5000 BC. From the 3rd to the 13th centuries AD, the Iron Age
Bura culture existed in the territory of present-day southeastern Burkina Faso
and southwestern Niger. Various ethnic groups of present-day Burkina Faso, such
as the Mossi, Fula and Dyula, arrived in successive waves between the 8th and
15th centuries. From the 11th century the Mossi people established several
separate kingdoms. In the 1890s, during the European Scramble for Africa, the
territory of Burkina Faso was invaded by France, and colonial control was
established following a war of conquest between 1896 and 1904. The territory
was made part of French West Africa in 1904, and the colony of French Upper
Volta was established on 1&nbsp;March 1919. The colony was named for its
location on the upper courses of the Volta River (the Black, Red and White
Volta).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>The
Republic of Upper Volta was established on 11&nbsp;December 1958 as a
self-governing colony within the French Community, and on 5&nbsp;August 1960 it
gained full independence, with Maurice Yam</span><span style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>é<span
lang=EN-US>ogo as President. After protests by students and labour unions, Yam</span>é<span
lang=EN-US>ogo was deposed in the 1966 coup d'</span>é<span lang=EN-US>tat led
by Sangoul</span>é<span lang=EN-US> Lamizana, who became President. His rule
coincided with the Sahel drought and famine, and facing problems from the
country's traditionally powerful trade unions, he was deposed in the 1980 coup
d'</span>é<span lang=EN-US>tat led by Saye Zerbo. Encountering resistance from
trade unions again, Zerbo's government was overthrown in the 1982 coup d'</span>é<span
lang=EN-US>tat led by Jean-Baptiste Ou</span>é<span lang=EN-US>draogo. The
leader of the leftist faction of Ou</span>é<span lang=EN-US>draogo's
government, Thomas Sankara, became Prime Minister but was later imprisoned.
Efforts to free him led to the popularly-supported 1983 coup d'</span>é<span
lang=EN-US>tat, in which he became President. [9] [10] Sankara renamed the
country Burkina Faso and launched an ambitious socioeconomic program which
included a nationwide literacy campaign, land redistribution to peasants,
railway and road construction and the outlawing of female genital mutilation,
forced marriages and polygamy. [10] [11] Sankara was overthrown and killed in
the 1987 coup d'</span>é<span lang=EN-US>tat led by Blaise Compaor</span>é –<span
lang=EN-US> deteriorating relations with former coloniser France and its ally
the Ivory Coast was the reason given for the coup.</span></span></p>

Blaise Compaor</span><span style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>é<span
lang=EN-US> became President and, after an alleged 1989 coup attempt, was later
elected in 1991 and 1998, elections which were boycotted by the opposition and
received a considerably low turnout, as well as in 2005. He remained head of
state until he was ousted from power by the popular youth upheaval of
31&nbsp;October 2014, [12] [13] after which he fled to the Ivory Coast. Michel
Kafando subsequently became the transitional President of the country. On
16&nbsp;September 2015 a military coup d'</span>é<span lang=EN-US>tat against
the Kafando government was carried out by the Regiment of Presidential
Security, the former presidential guard of Compaor</span>é<span lang=EN-US>.
[14] On 24&nbsp;September 2015, after pressure from the African Union, ECOWAS
and the armed forces, the military junta agreed to step down, and Michel
Kafando was reinstated as Acting President. [15] In the general election held
on 29 November 2015, Roch Marc Christian Kabor</span>é<span lang=EN-US> won in
the first round with 53.5% of the vote [16] and was sworn in as President on
29&nbsp;December 2015. [17]</span></span></p>
