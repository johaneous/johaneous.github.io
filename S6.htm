<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Sale</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>, () contracts. An agreement by
which one of the contracting parties, called the seller, gives a thing and
passes the title to it, in exchange for a certain price in current money, to
the other party, who is called the buyer or purchaser, who, on his part, agrees
to pay such price. Pard. Dr. Com. n. 6; Noy's Max. ch. 42; Shep. Touch. 244; 2

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Sale</span></b><span

barter or exchange in this, that in the latter the price or consideration,
instead of being paid in money, is paid in goods or merchandise, susceptible of
a valuation. It differs from accord and satisfaction, because in that contract,
the thing is given for the purpose of quieting a claim, and not for a price. An
onerous gift, when the burden it imposes is the payment of a sum of money, is,
when accepted, in the nature of a sale. When partition is made between two or
more joint owners of a chattel, it would seem, the contract is in the nature of
a barter. See 11 Pick. 311.</span></p>

sui juris may be either buyers or sellers. But to this rule there are several
exceptions. 1. There is a class of persons who are incapable of purchasing
except sub modo, as infants, and married women; and, 2. Another class, who, in
consequence of their peculiar relation with regard to the owner of the thing
sold, are totally incapable of becoming purchasers, while that relation exists;
these are trustees, guardians, assignees of insolvents, and generally all persons
who, by their connexion with the owner, or by being employed concerning his affairs,
have acquired, a knowledge of his property, as attorneys, conveyancers, and the
like. See Purchaser.</span></p>

ceased to exist it is clear there can be no sale; if, for example, Paul sell
his horse to Peter, and, at the time of the sale the horse be dead, though the
fact was unknown to both parties: or, if you and I being in Philadelphia, I
sell you my house in Cincinnati, and, at the time of the sale it be burned
down, it is manifest there was no sale, as there was not a thing to be sold. It
is evident, too, that no sale can be made of things not in commerce, as the
air, the water of the sea, and the like. When there has been a mistake made as
to the article sold, there is no sale; as, for example, where a broker, who is
the agent of both parties, sells an article and delivers to the seller a sold
note describing the article sold as &quot;St. Petersburg clean hemp,&quot; and
bought note to, the buyer, as &quot;Riga Rhine hemp,&quot; there is no sale. 5

the three following qualities, to wit: 1. It must be an actual or serious

the same agreement by which the title to the thing is passed to him discharging
him from all obligations to pay for it. As to the quantum of the price that is

price must be certain or determined, but it is sufficiently certain, if, as
before observed, it be left to the determination of a third person. 4 Pick.

is sufficiently certain. Coxe, 261; Poth. Vente, n. 26. 3. The price must
consist in a sum of money which the buyer agrees to pay to the seller, for if
paid for in any other way, the contract would be an exchange or barter, and not
a sale, as before observed.</span></p>

contracting parties, which is of the essence of a sale, consists in the
agreement of the will of the seller to sell a certain thing to the buyer, for a
certain price, and in the will of the buyer, to purchase the same thing for the
same, price. Care must be taken to distinguish between an agreement to enter
into a future contract, and a present actual agreement to make a sale. This
consent may be shown, 1. By an express agreement. 2. By all implied agreement.</span></p>

upwards, shall be allowed to be good, except the buyer shall accept part of the
goods so sold, and actually receive the same, or give something in earnest to

if therefore one give consent to buy one thing, and the other to sell another,
there is no sale; nor is there a sale if one sells me a bag full of oats, which
I understand is full of wheat; because there is no consent as to the thing
which is the object of the sale. But the sale would be valid, although I might
be mistaken as to the quality of the tiling sold. 20 John. 196 3 Rawle, 23,
168. 2d. Both parties must agree as to the same price, for if the seller intends
to sell for a greater sum than the buyer intends to give, there is no mutual consent;
but if the case were reversed, and the seller intended to sell for a less price
than the buyer intended to give, the sale would be good for the lesser sum.
Poth. Vente, n. 36. 3d. The consent must be on the sale itself, that is, one
intends to sell, and the other to buy. If, therefore, Peter intended to lease
his house for three hundred dollars a year for ten years, and Paul intended to
buy it for three thousand dollars, there would not be a contract of sale nor a
lease. Poth. Vente, n. 37.</span></p>

property by a sale, there must be an express or implied agreement that the
title shall pass. An agreement for the sale of goods is prima facie a bargain
and sale of those goods; but this arises merely from the presumed intention of
the parties, and if it appear that the parties have agreed, not that there
shall be a mutual credit by which the property is to pass from the seller to
the buyer, and the buyer is bound to pay the price to the seller, but that the
exchange of the money for the goods shall be made on the. spot, no property is
transferred, for it is not the intention of the parties to transfer any. 4
Wash. C. C. R. 79. But, on the contrary, when the making of part payment, or
naming a day for payment, clearly shows an intention in the parties that they
should have some time to complete the sale by payment and delivery, and that
they should in the meantime be trustees for each other, the one of the property
in the chattel, and the other in the price. As a general rule, when a bargain
is made for the purchase of goods, and nothing is said about payment and.
delivery, the property passes immediately, so as to cast upon the purchaser all
future risk, if nothing remains to be done to the goods, although he cannot
take them away without paying the price. 5 B. &amp; C. 862. </span></p>
