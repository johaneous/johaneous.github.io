Local death is going on at all times and in all parts of the living body, in
which individual cells and elements are being cast off and replaced by new; a
process essential to life. General death is of two kinds; death of the body as
a whole (somatic or systemic death), and death of the tissues. By the former is
implied the absolute cessation of the functions of the brain, the circulatory
and the respiratory organs; by the latter the entire disappearance of the vital
actions of the ultimate structural constituents of the body. When death takes
place, the body as a whole dies first, the death of the tissues sometimes not
occurring until after a considerable interval. -- Huxley.</span></p>

Death applies to the termination of every form of existence, both animal and

sometimes used of distinguished men in general; as, the demise of Mr. Pitt.
Departure and release are peculiarly terms of Christian affection and hope. A
violent death is not usually called a decease. Departure implies a friendly
taking leave of life. Release implies a deliverance from a life of suffering or
sorrow.</span></p>

jurisprudence, by the light and information which it can bestow, to aid in the
detection of crimes against the persons of others, in order to subject them to the
punishment which is awarded by the criminal law. Medical men are very
frequently called upon to make examinations of the bodies of persons. who have
been found dead, for the purpose of ascertaining the causes of their death.
When it is recollected that the honor, the fortune, and even the life of the
citizen, as well as the distribution of impartial justice, frequently depend on
these examinations, one cannot but be struck at the responsibility which rests
upon such medical men, particularly when the numerous qualities which are
indispensably requisite to form a correct judgment, are considered. In order to
form a correct opinion, the physician must be not only skilled in his art, but
he must have made such examinations his special study. A man may be an
enlightened physician, and yet he may find it exceedingly difficult to resolve,
properly, the grave and almost always complicated questions which arise in
cases of this kind. Judiciary annals, unfortunately, afford but too many
examples of the fatal mistakes made by physicians, and others, when considering
cases of violent deaths.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Death</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>, () In the examination of bodies
of persons who have come to a violent death, every precaution should be taken
to ascertain the situation of the place where the body was found; as to whether
the ground appears to have been disturbed from its natural condition; whether
there are any marks of footsteps, their size, their number, the direction to
which they lead, and whence they came - whether any traces of blood or hair can
be found - and whether any, and what weapons or instruments, which could have
caused death, are found in the vicinity; and these instruments should be
carefully preserved so that they may be identified. A case or two may here be
mentioned, to show the importance of examining the ground in order to ascertain
the facts. Mr. Jeffries was murdered at Walthamstow, in England, in 1751, by
his niece and servant. The perpetrators were suspected from the single
circumstance that the dew on the ground surrounding the house had not been
disturbed on the morning of the murder. Mr. Taylor, of Hornsey, was murdered in
December, 1818, and his body thrown into the river. It was evident he, had not
gone into the river willingly, as the hands were found clenched and contained grass,
which, in the struggle, he had torn from the bank. The marks of footsteps,
particularly in the snow, have been found, not unfrequently, to correspond with
the shoes or feet of suspected persons, and led to their detection. Paris, Med.

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Death</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>, () In the survey of the body
the following rules should be observed: 1. It should be as thoroughly examined
as possible without changing its position or that of any of the limbs; this is
particularly desirable when, from appearances, the death has been caused by a
wound, because by moving it, the altitude of the extremities may be altered, or
the state of a fracture or luxation changed; for the internal parts vary in
their position with one another, according to the general position of the body.
When it is requisite to remove it, it should be done with great caution. 2. The
clothes should be removed, as far as necessary, and it should be noted what
compresses or bandages (if any) are applied to particular parts, and to what
extent. 3. The color of the skin, the temperature of the body, the rigidity or
flexibility of the extremities, the state of the eyes, and of the sphincter
muscles, noting at the same time whatever swellings, ecchymosis, or livid,
black, or yellow spots, wounds, ulcer, contusion, fracture, or luxation may be
present. The fluids from the nose, mouth, ears, sexual organs, &amp;c., should
be examined; and, when the deceased is a female, it may be proper to examine
the sexual organs with care, in order to ascertain whether before death she was
ravished or not. 1 Briand, Med. Leg. 2eme partio, ch. 1, art. 3, n. 5, p. 318.
4. The clothes of the deceased should be carefully examined, and if parts are
torn or defaced, this fact should be noted. A list should also be made of the
articles found on the body, and of their state or condition, as whether the
purse of the deceased had been opened; whether he had any money, &amp;c. 5. The
state of the body as to decomposition should be, particularly stated, as by
this it may sometimes be ascertained when the death took place; experience
proves that in general after the expiration of fourteen days After death,
decomposition has so far advanced, that identity cannot be ascertained,
excepting in some strongly developed peculiarity; but in a drowned body,
adipocire is not produced until five or six weeks after death but this depends
upon circumstance's, and varies according to climate, season, &amp;c. It is
exceedingly important, however to keep this fact in view in some judicial
inquiries relative to the time of death. 1 Chit. Med. Jur. 443. A memorandum
should be made of all the facts as they are ascertained when possible, it
should be made on the ground, but when this cannot be done, as when chemical
experiments are to be made, or the body is to be dissected, they should be made
in the place where these operations are performed. 1 Beck's Med. Jur. 5; Dr.
