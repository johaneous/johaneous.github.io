<b>JUDGMENT</b>, () practice. The decision or sentence of the law, given by a
court of <br>
&nbsp; justice or other competent tribunal, as the result of proceedings
instituted <br>
&nbsp; therein, for the redress of an injury. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, () The language of
judgments, therefore, is not that &quot;it is decreed,&quot; <br>
&nbsp; or &quot;resolved,&quot; by the court; but &quot;it is considered,&quot;
(consideratum est per <br>
&nbsp; curiam) that the plaintiff recover his debt, damages, or possession, as
the <br>
&nbsp; case may require, or that the defendant do go without day. This implies
that <br>
&nbsp; the judgment is not so much the decision of the court, as the sentence
of <br>
&nbsp; the law pronounced and decreed by the court, after due deliberation and <br>
&nbsp; inquiry. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 3. To be valid, a
judicial judgment must be given by a competent judge <br>
&nbsp; or court, at a time and place appointed by law, and in the form it
requires. <br>
&nbsp; A judgment would be null, if the judge had not jurisdiction of the
matter; <br>
&nbsp; or, having such jurisdiction, he exercised it when there was no court
held, <br>
&nbsp; or but of his district; or if be rendered a judgment before the cause
was <br>
&nbsp; prepared for a hearing. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 4. The judgment must
confine itself to the question raised before the <br>
&nbsp; court, and cannot extend beyond it. For example, where the plaintiff
sued <br>
&nbsp; for an injury committed on his lands by animals owned and kept
carelessly by <br>
&nbsp; defendant, the judgment may be for damages, but it cannot command the <br>
&nbsp; defendant for the future to keep his cattle out of the plaintiff's land.
<br>
&nbsp; That would be to usurp the power of the legislature. A judgment declares
the <br>
&nbsp; rights which belong to the citizen, the law alone rules future actions.
The <br>
&nbsp; law commands all men, it is the same for all, because it is general; <br>
&nbsp; judgments are particular decisions, which apply only to particular
persons, <br>
&nbsp; and bind no others; they vary like the circumstances on which they are <br>
&nbsp; founded. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 5. Litigious contests
present to the courts facts to appreciate, <br>
&nbsp; agreements to be construed, and points of law to be resolved. The
judgment <br>
&nbsp; is the result of the full examination of all these. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 6. There are four kinds
of judgments in civil cases, namely: 1. When <br>
&nbsp; the facts are admitted by the parties, but the law is disputed; as in
case <br>
&nbsp; of judgment upon demurrer. 2. When the law is admitted, but the facts
are <br>
&nbsp; disputed; as in, case of judgment upon a verdict. 3. When both the law
and <br>
&nbsp; the facts are admitted by confession; as, in the case of cognovit
actionem, <br>
&nbsp; on the part of the defendant; or nolle prosequi, on the part of the <br>
&nbsp; plaintiff. 4. By default of either party in the course of legal
proceedings, <br>
&nbsp; as in the case of judgment by nihil dicit, or non sum informatus, when
the <br>
&nbsp; defendant has omitted to plead or instruct his attorney to do so, after
a <br>
&nbsp; proper notice or in cases of judgment by non pros; or, as in case of <br>
&nbsp; nonsuit, when the plaintiff omits to follow up his proceedings. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 7. These four species
of judgments, again, are either interlocutory or <br>
&nbsp; final. Vide 3 Black. Com. 396; Bing. on Judg. 1. For the lien of

&nbsp; in the several estates, vide Lien. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 8. A list of the
various judgments is here given.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, ()  9. Judgment in
assumpsit is either in favor of the plaintiff or <br>
&nbsp; defendant; when in favor of the plaintiff, it is that he recover a
specified <br>
&nbsp; sum, assessed by a jury, or on reference to the prothonotary, or other <br>
&nbsp; proper officer, for the damages which he has sustained, by reason of the
<br>
&nbsp; defendant's non-performance of his promises and undertakings, and for
full <br>
&nbsp; costs of suit. 1 Chit. Pl. 100. When the judgment is for the defendant,
it <br>
&nbsp; is that he recover his costs. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, () Judgment in actions on the
case for torts, when for the plaintiff, <br>
&nbsp; is that he recover a sum of money ascertained by a jury for his damages <br>
&nbsp; occasioned by the committing of the grievances complained of, and the
costs <br>
&nbsp; of suit. 1 Ch. Pl. 147. When for the defendant, it is for costs. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, ()  11. Judgment of cassetur
breve, or billa, is in cases of pleas in <br>
&nbsp; abatement where the plaintiff prays that his &quot;writ&quot; or
&quot;bill&quot; &quot;may be <br>
&nbsp; quashed, that he may sue or exhibit a better one.&quot; Steph. Pl. 130,
131, 128 <br>
&nbsp; Lawes, Civ. PI. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, ()  12. Judgment by confession.
When instead of entering a plea, the <br>
&nbsp; defendant chooses to confess the action; or, after pleading; he does, at
any <br>
&nbsp; time before trial, both confess the action and withdraw his plea or
other <br>
&nbsp; allegations; the judgment against him, in these two cases, is called a <br>
&nbsp; judgment by confession or by confession relicta verificatione. Steph.
Pl. <br>
&nbsp; 130. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, ()  13. Contradictory judgment.
By this term is understood, in the state of <br>
&nbsp; Louisiana, a judgment which has been given after the parties have been <br>
&nbsp; heard, either in support of their claims, or in their defence. Code of <br>
&nbsp; Pract. art. 535; 11 L. R. 366, 569. A judgment is called contradictory
to <br>
&nbsp; distinguish it from one which is rendered by default. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 14. Judgment in covenant;
when for the plaintiff, is that he recover an <br>
&nbsp; ascertained sum for his damages, which he has sustained by reason of the
<br>
&nbsp; breach or breaches of the defendant's covenant, together with costs of
suit. <br>
&nbsp; 1 Chitty's Plead. 116, 117. When for the defendant, the judgment, is for
<br>
&nbsp; costs. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, ()  15. Judgment in the action
of debt; when for the plaintiff, is that he <br>
&nbsp; recover his debt, and in general, nominal damages for the detention
thereof; <br>
&nbsp; and in cases under the 8 and 9 Wm. III. c. 11, it is also awarded, that
the <br>
&nbsp; plaintiff have execution for the damages sustained by the breach of a
bond, <br>
&nbsp; conditioned for the performance of covenants; and that plaintiff recover
<br>
&nbsp; full costs of suit. 1 Chitty's Pl. 108, 9. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, ()  16. In some penal and other
particular actions the plaintiff does not, <br>
&nbsp; however, always recover costs. Espinasse on Pen. Act. 154: Hull. on

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, ()  17. When the judgment is for
the defendant, it is generally for costs. <br>
&nbsp; In some penal actions, however, neither party can recover costs, 5

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, ()  18. Judgment by default, is

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 2l. Judgment in error, is a
judgment rendered by a court of error, on a <br>
&nbsp; record sent up, from an inferior court. These judgments are of two
kinds, of <br>
&nbsp; affirmance and reversal. When the judgment is for the defendant in
error, <br>
&nbsp; whether the errors assigned be in law or in fact, it is &quot;that the
former <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;judgment be affirmed, and stand in full force and effect, the said
causes <br>
&nbsp; and matters assigned for error notwithstanding, and that the defendant
in <br>
&nbsp; error recover $____ for his damages, charges and costs which he hath <br>
&nbsp; sustained,&quot; &amp;c. 2 Tidd's Pr. 1126; Arch. Forms, 221. When it is
for the <br>
&nbsp; plaintiff in error, the judgment is that it be reversed or recalled. It
is <br>
&nbsp; to be reversed for error in law, in this form, that it be reversed,
annulled <br>
&nbsp; and altogether holden for nought.&quot; Arch. Forms, 224. For error in
fact the, <br>
&nbsp; judgment is recalled, revocatur. 2 Tidd's Pr. 1126. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b> 22. A final judgment is one which
puts an end to the suit.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, ()  23. When the issue is one in
fact, and is tried by a jury, the jury at  the time that they try the issue,
assess the damages, and the judgment is final in the first instance, and is
that the plaintiff do recover the  damages assessed. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, ()  24. When an interlocutory
judgment has been rendered, and a writ of <br>
&nbsp; inquiry has issued to ascertain the damages, on the return of the <br>
&nbsp; inquisition the plaintiff is entitled to a final judgment, namely, that
he <br>
&nbsp; recover the amount of damages so assessed. Steph. Pl. 127, 128. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, ()  25. An interlocutory
judgment, is one given in the course of a cause, <br>
&nbsp; before final judgment. When the action sounds in damages, and the issue
is <br>
&nbsp; an issue in law, or when any issue in fact not tried by a jury is
decided in <br>
&nbsp; favor of the plaintiff, then the judgment is that the plaintiff ought to
<br>
&nbsp; recover his damages without specifying their amount; for, as there has
been <br>
&nbsp; no trial by jury in the case, the amount of damages is not yet
ascertained. <br>
&nbsp; The judgment is then said to be interlocutory. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 26. To ascertain such damages
it is the practice to issue a writ of <br>
&nbsp; inquiry. Steph. Pl. 127. When the action is founded on a promissory
note, <br>
&nbsp; bond, or other writing, or any other contract by which the amount due
may be <br>
&nbsp; readily computed, the practice is, in some courts, to refer it to the <br>
&nbsp; prothonotary or clerk to assess the damages. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 27. There is one species of
interlocutory judgment which establishes <br>
&nbsp; nothing but the inadequacy of the defence set up this is the judgment
for <br>
&nbsp; the plaintiff on demurrer to a plea in abatement, by which it appears
that <br>
&nbsp; the defendant has mistaken the law on a point which does not affect the <br>
&nbsp; merits of his case; and it being but reasonable that he should offer, if
he <br>
&nbsp; can, a further defence, that judgment is that he do answer over, in <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, ()  28. Judgment of nil capiat
per breve or per billam. When an issue arises <br>
&nbsp; upon a declaration or peremptory plea, and it is decided in favor of the
<br>
&nbsp; defendant, the judgment is, in general, that, the plaintiff take nothing
by <br>
&nbsp; his writ, (or bill,) and that the defendant go thereof without day,
&amp;c. This <br>
&nbsp; is called a judgment of nil capiat per breve, or per billam. Steph. Pl.
128. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 29. Judgment by nil dicit, is
one rendered against a defendant for want <br>
&nbsp; of a plea. The plaintiff obtains a rule on the defendant to plead within
a <br>
&nbsp; time specified, of which he serves a notice on the defendant or his <br>
&nbsp; attorney; if the defendant neglect to enter a plea within the time <br>
&nbsp; specified, the plaintiff may sign judgment against him. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, ()  30. Judgment of nolle
prosequi, is a judgment entered against the <br>
&nbsp; plaintiff, where, after appearance and before judgment, he says,
&quot;he will <br>
&nbsp; not further prosecute his suit.&quot; Steph. Pl. 130 Lawes Civ. Pl. 166.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 31. Judgment of non obstante
veredicto, is a judgment rendered in favor <br>
&nbsp; of the plaintiff, without regard to the verdict obtained by the
defendant. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, ()  32. The motion for such
judgment is made where after a pleading by the <br>
&nbsp; defendant in confession and avoidance, as, for example, a plea in bar,
and <br>
&nbsp; issue joined thereon, and verdict found for, the defendant, the
plaintiff on <br>
&nbsp; retrospective examination of the record, conceives that such plea was
bad in <br>
&nbsp; substance, and might have been made the subject of demurrer on that
ground. <br>
&nbsp; If the plea was itself substantially bad in law, of course the verdict, <br>
&nbsp; which merely shows it to be true in point of fact, cannot avail to
entitle <br>
&nbsp; the defendant to judgment; while on the other hand the plea being in <br>
&nbsp; confession and avoidance, involves a confession of the plaintiff's <br>
&nbsp; declaration, and shows that he was entitled. to maintain his action. In
such <br>
&nbsp; case, therefore, this court will give judgment for the plaintiff,
without <br>
&nbsp; regard to the verdict; and this, for the reasons above explained, is
called <br>
&nbsp; a judgment upon confession. Sometimes it may be expedient for the
plaintiff <br>
&nbsp; to move for judgment non obstante, &amp;c., even though the verdict be
in his <br>
&nbsp; own favor; for, if in such case as above described, he takes judgment as
<br>
&nbsp; upon the verdict, it seems that such judgment would be erroneous, and
that <br>
&nbsp; the only safe course is to take it as upon confession. 1 Wils. 63; Cro. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, ()  33. Judgment by non sum
informatus, is one which is rendered, when <br>
&nbsp; instead of entering a plea, the defendant's attorney says he is not
informed <br>
&nbsp; of any answer to be given to the action. Steph. Pl. 130. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, ()  34. Judgment of non pros.
(from non prosequitur,) is one given against <br>
&nbsp; the plaintiff, in any class of actions, for not declaring, or replying,
or <br>
&nbsp; surrejoining, &amp;c., or for not entering the issue. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, ()  35. Judgment of nonsuit,
Practice, is one against the plaintiff, which <br>
&nbsp; happens when, on trial by jury, the plaintiff, on being called or
demanded, <br>
&nbsp; at the instance of the defendant, to be present while the jury give
their <br>
&nbsp; verdict, fails to make his appearance. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 36. In this case, no verdict
is given, but the judgment of nonsuit <br>
&nbsp; passes against the plaintiff. So if, after issue be joined, the
plaintiff <br>
&nbsp; neglect to bring such issue on to be tried in due time, as limited by
the <br>
&nbsp; practice of the court, in the particular case, judgment will be also
given <br>
&nbsp; against him for this default; and it is called judgment as in case of <br>
&nbsp; nonsuit. Steph. Pl. 131. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 37. After suffering a nonsuit, the plaintiff may
commence another action <br>
&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, ()  for the same cause for which the first had been
instituted. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUDGMENT</b>, ()  38. In some cases,
plaintiffs having obtained information in what manner <br>
&nbsp; the jury had agreed upon their verdict before it was delivered in court,
<br>
&nbsp; have, when the jury were ready to give in such verdict against them, <br>
&nbsp; suffered a nonsuit for the purpose of commencing another action and <br>
&nbsp; obtaining another trial. To prevent this abuse, the legislature of <br>
&nbsp; Pennsylvania have provided, by the Act of March 28, 1814, 6:Reed's L.
208, <br>
&nbsp; that &quot;whenever on the trial of any cause, the jury shall be ready
to give in <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;their verdict, the plaintiff shall not be called, nor shall he then
be <br>
&nbsp; permitted to suffer a nonsuit.&quot; <br>

When the declaration is in the detinuit, <br>

this <br>
&nbsp; without his first assigning the purpose for which they were taken,
because, <br>
&nbsp; by abandoning his suit, the plaintiff admits that he had no right to <br>
&nbsp; dispossess the defendant by prosecuting the replevin. The form of this <br>
&nbsp; judgment. is simply &quot;to have a return,&quot; without adding the
words &quot;to hold <br>
