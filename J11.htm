subject of demurrer on that ground. If the plea was itself substantially bad in
law, of course the verdict, which merely shows it to be true in point of fact,
cannot avail to entitle the defendant to judgment; while on the other hand the
plea being in confession and avoidance, involves a confession of the
plaintiff's declaration, and shows that he was entitled. to maintain his
action. In such case, therefore, this court will give judgment for the
plaintiff, without regard to the verdict; and this, for the reasons above
