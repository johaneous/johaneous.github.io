<b>JUDGMENT</b>, () practice. The decision or sentence of the law, given by a
court of <br>justice or other competent tribunal, as the result of proceedings
instituted <br>therein, for the redress of an injury. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () The language of
judgments, therefore, is not that "it is decreed," <br>or "resolved," by the court; but "it is considered,"
(consideratum est per <br>curiam) that the plaintiff recover his debt, damages, or possession, as
the <br>case may require, or that the defendant do go without day. This implies
that <br>the judgment is not so much the decision of the court, as the sentence
of <br>the law pronounced and decreed by the court, after due deliberation and <br>inquiry. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 3. To be valid, a
judicial judgment must be given by a competent judge <br>or court, at a time and place appointed by law, and in the form it
requires. <br>A judgment would be null, if the judge had not jurisdiction of the
matter; <br>or, having such jurisdiction, he exercised it when there was no court
held, <br>or but of his district; or if be rendered a judgment before the cause
was <br>prepared for a hearing. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 4. The judgment must
confine itself to the question raised before the <br>court, and cannot extend beyond it. For example, where the plaintiff
sued <br>for an injury committed on his lands by animals owned and kept
carelessly by <br>defendant, the judgment may be for damages, but it cannot command the <br>defendant for the future to keep his cattle out of the plaintiff's land.
<br>That would be to usurp the power of the legislature. A judgment declares
the <br>rights which belong to the citizen, the law alone rules future actions.
The <br>law commands all men, it is the same for all, because it is general; <br>judgments are particular decisions, which apply only to particular
persons, <br>and bind no others; they vary like the circumstances on which they are <br>founded. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 5. Litigious contests
present to the courts facts to appreciate, <br>agreements to be construed, and points of law to be resolved. The
judgment <br>is the result of the full examination of all these. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 6. There are four kinds
of judgments in civil cases, namely: 1. When <br>the facts are admitted by the parties, but the law is disputed; as in
case <br>of judgment upon demurrer. 2. When the law is admitted, but the facts
are <br>disputed; as in, case of judgment upon a verdict. 3. When both the law
and <br>the facts are admitted by confession; as, in the case of cognovit
actionem, <br>on the part of the defendant; or nolle prosequi, on the part of the <br>

proceedings, <br>as in the case of judgment by nihil dicit, or non sum informatus, when
the <br>defendant has omitted to plead or instruct his attorney to do so, after
a <br>proper notice or in cases of judgment by non pros; or, as in case of <br>nonsuit, when the plaintiff omits to follow up his proceedings. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 7. These four species
of judgments, again, are either interlocutory or <br>final. Vide 3 Black. Com. 396; Bing. on Judg. 1. For the lien of
judgment <br>in the several estates, vide Lien. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 8. A list of the
various judgments is here given.<br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () &nbsp;9. Judgment in
assumpsit is either in favor of the plaintiff or <br>defendant; when in favor of the plaintiff, it is that he recover a
specified <br>sum, assessed by a jury, or on reference to the prothonotary, or other <br>proper officer, for the damages which he has sustained, by reason of the
<br>defendant's non-performance of his promises and undertakings, and for
full <br>costs of suit. 1 Chit. Pl. 100. When the judgment is for the defendant,
it <br>is that he recover his costs. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () Judgment in actions on the
case for torts, when for the plaintiff, <br>is that he recover a sum of money ascertained by a jury for his damages <br>occasioned by the committing of the grievances complained of, and the
costs <br>of suit. 1 Ch. Pl. 147. When for the defendant, it is for costs. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () &nbsp;11. Judgment of cassetur
breve, or billa, is in cases of pleas in <br>abatement where the plaintiff prays that his "writ" or
"bill" "may be <br>quashed, that he may sue or exhibit a better one." Steph. Pl. 130,
131, 128 <br>Lawes, Civ. PI. <br><b>UDGMENT</b>, () &nbsp;12. Judgment by confession.
When instead of entering a plea, the <br>defendant chooses to confess the action; or, after pleading; he does, at
any <br>time before trial, both confess the action and withdraw his plea or
other <br>allegations; the judgment against him, in these two cases, is called a <br>judgment by confession or by confession relicta verificatione. Steph.
Pl. <br>130. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () &nbsp;13. Contradictory judgment.
By this term is understood, in the state of <br>Louisiana, a judgment which has been given after the parties have been <br>heard, either in support of their claims, or in their defence. Code of <br>Pract. art. 535; 11 L. R. 366, 569. A judgment is called contradictory
to <br>distinguish it from one which is rendered by default. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 14. Judgment in covenant;
when for the plaintiff, is that he recover an <br>ascertained sum for his damages, which he has sustained by reason of the
<br>breach or breaches of the defendant's covenant, together with costs of
suit. <br>1 Chitty's Plead. 116, 117. When for the defendant, the judgment, is for
<br>costs. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () &nbsp;15. Judgment in the action
of debt; when for the plaintiff, is that he <br>recover his debt, and in general, nominal damages for the detention
thereof; <br>and in cases under the 8 and 9 Wm. III. c. 11, it is also awarded, that
the <br>plaintiff have execution for the damages sustained by the breach of a
bond, <br>conditioned for the performance of covenants; and that plaintiff recover
<br>full costs of suit. 1 Chitty's Pl. 108, 9. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 16. In some penal and other
particular actions the plaintiff does not, <br>however, always recover costs. Espinasse on Pen. Act. 154: Hull. on
Costs, <br>200; Bull. N. P. 333; 5 Johns. R. 251. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 17. When the judgment is for
the defendant, it is generally for costs. <br>In some penal actions, however, neither party can recover costs, 5
Johns. R. <br>251. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 18. Judgment by default, is
a judgment rendered in consequence of tho <br>non-appearance of the defendant, and is either by nil dicit; vide
Judgment <br>by nil dicit, or by non sum informatus; vide Judgment by non sum
informatus. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 19. This judgment is
interlocutory in assumpsit, covenant, trespass, <br>case, and replevin, where the sole object of the action is damages; but
in <br>debt, damages not being the principal object of the action, the
plaintiff <br>usually signs final judgment in the first instance. Vide Com. Dig.
Pleader, <br>B 11 and 12, E 42; 7 Vin. Ab. 429; Doct. Pl. 208; Grah. Pr, 631 Dane's
Ab. <br>Index, h.t.; 3 Chit. Pr. 671 to 680; Tidd's Pr. 563; 1 Lilly's Reg. 585;
<br>and article Default. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 20. Judgment in the action
of detinue; when for the plaintiff, is in the <br>alternative, that he recover the goods, or the value thereof, if he
cannot <br>have the goods themselves, and his damage for the detention and costs. 1
Ch. <br>Pl. l21, 2; 1 Dall. R. 458. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 2l. Judgment in error, is a
judgment rendered by a court of error, on a <br>record sent up, from an inferior court. These judgments are of two
kinds, of <br>affirmance and reversal. When the judgment is for the defendant in
error, <br>whether the errors assigned be in law or in fact, it is "that the
former <br>judgment be affirmed, and stand in full force and effect, the said
causes <br>and matters assigned for error notwithstanding, and that the defendant
in <br>error recover $____ for his damages, charges and costs which he hath <br>sustained," &amp;c. 2 Tidd's Pr. 1126; Arch. Forms, 221. When it is
for the <br>plaintiff in error, the judgment is that it be reversed or recalled. It
is <br>to be reversed for error in law, in this form, that it be reversed,
annulled <br>and altogether holden for nought." Arch. Forms, 224. For error in
fact the, <br>judgment is recalled, revocatur. 2 Tidd's Pr. 1126. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b> 22. A final judgment is one which
puts an end to the suit.<br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 23. When the issue is one in
fact, and is tried by a jury, the jury at &nbsp;the time that they try the issue,
assess the damages, and the judgment is final in the first instance, and is
that the plaintiff do recover the &nbsp;damages assessed. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () &nbsp;24. When an interlocutory
judgment has been rendered, and a writ of <br>inquiry has issued to ascertain the damages, on the return of the <br>inquisition the plaintiff is entitled to a final judgment, namely, that
he <br>recover the amount of damages so assessed. Steph. Pl. 127, 128. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () &nbsp;25. An interlocutory
judgment, is one given in the course of a cause, <br>before final judgment. When the action sounds in damages, and the issue
is <br>an issue in law, or when any issue in fact not tried by a jury is
decided in <br>favor of the plaintiff, then the judgment is that the plaintiff ought to
<br>recover his damages without specifying their amount; for, as there has
been <br>no trial by jury in the case, the amount of damages is not yet
ascertained. <br>The judgment is then said to be interlocutory. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 26. To ascertain such damages
it is the practice to issue a writ of <br>inquiry. Steph. Pl. 127. When the action is founded on a promissory
note, <br>bond, or other writing, or any other contract by which the amount due
may be <br>readily computed, the practice is, in some courts, to refer it to the <br>prothonotary or clerk to assess the damages. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 27. There is one species of
interlocutory judgment which establishes <br>nothing but the inadequacy of the defence set up this is the judgment
for <br>the plaintiff on demurrer to a plea in abatement, by which it appears
that <br>the defendant has mistaken the law on a point which does not affect the <br>merits of his case; and it being but reasonable that he should offer, if
he <br>can, a further defence, that judgment is that he do answer over, in <br>technical language, judgment of respondeat ouster. (q.v.) Steph. Plead, <br>126; Bac. Ab. Pleas, N. 4; 2 Arch. Pr. 3. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () &nbsp;28. Judgment of nil capiat
per breve or per billam. When an issue arises <br>upon a declaration or peremptory plea, and it is decided in favor of the
<br>defendant, the judgment is, in general, that, the plaintiff take nothing
by <br>his writ, (or bill,) and that the defendant go thereof without day,
&amp;c. This <br>is called a judgment of nil capiat per breve, or per billam. Steph. Pl.
128. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 29. Judgment by nil dicit, is
one rendered against a defendant for want <br>of a plea. The plaintiff obtains a rule on the defendant to plead within
a <br>time specified, of which he serves a notice on the defendant or his <br>attorney; if the defendant neglect to enter a plea within the time <br>specified, the plaintiff may sign judgment against him. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () &nbsp;30. Judgment of nolle
prosequi, is a judgment entered against the <br>plaintiff, where, after appearance and before judgment, he says,
"he will <br>not further prosecute his suit." Steph. Pl. 130 Lawes Civ. Pl. 166.
<br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 31. Judgment of non obstante
veredicto, is a judgment rendered in favor <br>of the plaintiff, without regard to the verdict obtained by the
defendant. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () &nbsp;32. The motion for such
judgment is made where after a pleading by the <br>defendant in confession and avoidance, as, for example, a plea in bar,
and <br>issue joined thereon, and verdict found for, the defendant, the
plaintiff on <br>retrospective examination of the record, conceives that such plea was
bad in <br>substance, and might have been made the subject of demurrer on that
ground. <br>If the plea was itself substantially bad in law, of course the verdict, <br>which merely shows it to be true in point of fact, cannot avail to
entitle <br>the defendant to judgment; while on the other hand the plea being in <br>confession and avoidance, involves a confession of the plaintiff's <br>declaration, and shows that he was entitled. to maintain his action. In
such <br>case, therefore, this court will give judgment for the plaintiff,
without <br>regard to the verdict; and this, for the reasons above explained, is
called <br>a judgment upon confession. Sometimes it may be expedient for the
plaintiff <br>to move for judgment non obstante, &amp;c., even though the verdict be
in his <br>own favor; for, if in such case as above described, he takes judgment as
<br>upon the verdict, it seems that such judgment would be erroneous, and
that <br>the only safe course is to take it as upon confession. 1 Wils. 63; Cro. <br>Eliz, 778 2 Roll. Ab. 99. See also, Cro. Eliz. 2 1 4 6 Mod. 1 0; Str.
394; 1 <br>Ld. Raym. 641; 8 Taunt. 413; Rast. Ent. 622; 1 Wend. 307; 2 Wend. 624; 5
<br>Wend. 513; 4 Wend. 468; 6 Cowen, R. 225. See this Dict. Repleader, for
the <br>difference between a repleader and a judgment non obstante veredicto. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () &nbsp;33. Judgment by non sum
informatus, is one which is rendered, when <br>instead of entering a plea, the defendant's attorney says he is not
informed <br>of any answer to be given to the action. Steph. Pl. 130. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 34. Judgment of non pros.
(from non prosequitur,) is one given against <br>the plaintiff, in any class of actions, for not declaring, or replying,
or <br>surrejoining, &amp;c., or for not entering the issue. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 35. Judgment of nonsuit,
Practice, is one against the plaintiff, which <br>happens when, on trial by jury, the plaintiff, on being called or
demanded, <br>at the instance of the defendant, to be present while the jury give
their <br>verdict, fails to make his appearance. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 36. In this case, no verdict
is given, but the judgment of nonsuit <br>passes against the plaintiff. So if, after issue be joined, the
plaintiff <br>neglect to bring such issue on to be tried in due time, as limited by
the <br>practice of the court, in the particular case, judgment will be also
given <br>against him for this default; and it is called judgment as in case of <br>nonsuit. Steph. Pl. 131. <br>37. After suffering a nonsuit, the plaintiff may
commence another action <br>
<b>JUDGMENT</b>, () for the same cause for which the first had been
instituted. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 38. In some cases,
plaintiffs having obtained information in what manner <br>the jury had agreed upon their verdict before it was delivered in court,
<br>have, when the jury were ready to give in such verdict against them, <br>suffered a nonsuit for the purpose of commencing another action and <br>obtaining another trial. To prevent this abuse, the legislature of <br>Pennsylvania have provided, by the Act of March 28, 1814, 6:Reed's L.
208, <br>that "whenever on the trial of any cause, the jury shall be ready
to give in <br>their verdict, the plaintiff shall not be called, nor shall he then
be <br>permitted to suffer a nonsuit." <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 39. Judgment quod computet.
The name of an interlocutory judgment in an <br>action of account render that the defendant do account, quod computet.
Vide <br>4 Wash. C. C. R. 84; 2 Watts, R. 95; 1 Penn. R. 138. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 40. Judgment quod recuperet.
When an issue in law, other than one <br>arising on a dilatory plea, or an issue in fact, is decided in favor of
the <br>plaintiff, the judgment is, that the plaintiff do recover, which is
called a <br>judgment quod recuperet. Steph. Pl. 126; Com. Dig. Abatement, I 14, I
15; 2 <br>Arch. Pr. 3. This judgment is of two kinds, namely, interlocutory or
final. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 41. Judgment in replevin, is
either for the plaintiff or defendant. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 42.-1. For the plaintiff. 1.
When the declaration is in the detinuit, <br>that is, where the plaintiff declares, that the chattels "were
detained <br>until replevied by the sheriff," the judgment is that he recover
the damages <br>assessed by the jury for the taking and unjust detention, or for the
latter <br>only, where the former was justifiable, as also his costs. 5 Serg. &amp;
Rawle, <br>133 Ham. N. P. 488. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 43.-2. If the replevin is in
the detinet, that is, where the plaintiff <br>declares that the chattels taken are "yet detained," the jury
must find, <br>'in addition to the above, the value of the chattels, (assuming that
they <br>are still detained,) not in a gross sum, but each separate article; for
tho <br>defendant, perhaps, will restore some, in which case the plaintiff is to

If the replevin be abated, the judgment <br>is, that the writ or plaint abate, and that the defendant (having
avowed) <br>have a return of the chattels. <br><b>JUDGMENT</b>, () 46.-2. When the plaintiff is

this <br>without his first assigning the purpose for which they were taken,
because, <br>by abandoning his suit, the plaintiff admits that he had no right to <br>dispossess the defendant by prosecuting the replevin. The form of this <br>judgment. is simply "to have a return," without adding the
