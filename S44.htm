lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>, () crim. law. The right to
protect one's person and property from injury.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Self-defence</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>, () It will be proper to
consider, 1. The extent of the right of self-defence. 2. By whom it may be
exercised. 3. Against whom. 4. For what causes.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Self-defence</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>, () As to the extent of the
right, it may be laid down, first, that when threatened violence exists, it is
the duty of the person threatened to use all, prudent and precautionary
measures to prevent the attack; for example, if by closing a door which was
usually left open, one could prevent an attack, it would be prudent, and
perhaps the law might require, that it should be closed, in order to preserve
the peace, and the aggressor might in such case be held to bail for his good
behaviour; secondly, if, after having taken such proper precautions, a party
should be assailed, he may undoubtedly repel force by force, but in most
instances cannot, under the pretext that he has been attacked, use force enough
to kill the assailant or hurt him after he has secured himself from danger; as,
if a person unarmed enters a house to commit a larceny, while there he does not
threaten any one, nor does any act which manifests an intention to hurt any
one, and there are a number of persons present, who may easily secure him, no
one will be justifiable to do him any injury, much less to kill him; he ought
to be secured and delivered to the public authorities. But when an attack is
made by a thief under such circumstances, and it is impossible to ascertain to
what extent he may push it, the law does not requite the party assailed to
weigh with great nicety the probable extent of the attack, and he may use the
most violent means against his assailant, even to the taking of his life. For
homicide may be excused, se defendendo, where a man has no other probable means
of preserving his life from one who attacks him, while in the commission of a
felony, or even on a sudden quarrel, he beats him, so that he is reduced to
this inevitable necessity. Hawk. bk. 2, c. 11, s. 13. And the reason is that
when so reduced, he cannot call to his aid the power of society or of the
commonwealth, and, being unprotected by law, he reassumes his natural rights,
which the law sanctions, of killing his adversary to protect himself. Toull.
Dr. Civ. Fr. liv. 1, tit. 1, n. 210. See Pamph. Rep. of Selfridge's Trial in
1806 2 Swift's Ev. 283.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Self-defence</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>, () The party attacked may
undoubtedly defend himself, and the law further sanctions the mutual and
reciprocal defence of such as stand in the near relations of husband and wife,
patent and child, and master and servant. In these cases, if the party himself,
or any of these his relations, be forcibly attacked in their person or
property, it is lawful for him to repel force by force, for the law in these
cases respects the passions of the human mind, and makes, it lawful in him,
when external violence is offered to himself, or to those to whom he bears so
near a connexion, to do that immediate justice to which he is prompted by
nature, and which no prudential motives are strong enough to restrain. 2 Roll.

may be resisted, and if several persons join in such attack they may all be
resisted, and one may be killed although he may not himself have given the
immediate cause for such killing, if by his presence and his acts, he has aided
the assailant. See Conspiracy.</span></p>

crime, which if completed would amount to a felony; and of course under the
like circumstances, mayhem, wounding and battery would be excusable at common
law. 1 East, P. C. 271; 4 Bl. Com. 180. A man may repel force by force in
defence of his person, property or habitation, against any one who manifests,
intends, attempts, or endeavors, by violence or surprise, to commit a forcible
felony, such as murder, rape, robbery, arson, burglary and the like. In these
cases he is not required to retreat, but he may resist, and even pursue his
adversary, until he has secured himself from all danger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Self-defence</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>, () A man may defend himself
when no felony has been threatened or attempted; 1. When the assailant attempts
to beat another and there is no mutual combat; as, where one meets another and
attempts to commit or does commit an assault and battery on him, the person
attacked may defend himself; and an offer or, attempt to strike another, when
sufficiently near, so that that there is danger, the person assailed may strike
first, and is not required to wait until he has been struck. Bull. N. P. 18; 2
Roll. Ab. 547. 2. When there is a mutual combat upon a sudden quarrel. In these
cases both parties are the aggressors; and if in the fight one is killed it
will be manslaughter at least, unless the survivor can prove two things: 1st.
That before the mortal stroke was given be had refused any further combat, and
had retreated as far as he could with safety; and 2d. That he killed his
adversary from necessity, to avoid his own destruction.</span></p>
