</span><span style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>黏著語<span lang=EN-US> An
agglutinative language is a type of synthetic language with morphology that
primarily uses agglutination: words may contain different morphemes to determine
their meaning, but each of these morphemes (including stems and affixes)
remains in every aspect unchanged after their union, thus resulting in
generally more easily deducible word meanings if compared to fusional
languages, which allow modifications in either or both the phonetics or
spelling of one or more morphemes within a word, usually shortening the word or
providing easier pronunciation. Agglutinative languages have generally one
grammatical category per affix while fusional languages have multiple. The term
was introduced by Wilhelm von Humboldt to classify languages from a
morphological point of view. [1] It is derived from the Latin verb agglutinare,
which means &quot;to glue together&quot;. [2]</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Non-agglutinative
synthetic languages are fusional languages; morphologically, they combine
affixes by &quot;squeezing&quot; them together, drastically changing them in
the process, and joining several meanings in a single affix (for example, in
the Spanish word com</span><span style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>í<span
lang=EN-US> &quot;I ate&quot;, the suffix -</span>í<span lang=EN-US> carries
the meanings of first person, singular number, past tense, perfective aspect,
indicative mood, active voice.) The term agglutinative is sometimes incorrectly
used as a synonym for synthetic. Used in this way, the term embraces both
fusional languages and inflected languages[clarification needed]. The
agglutinative and fusional languages are two ends of a continuum, with various
languages falling more toward one or the other end. For example, Japanese is
generally agglutinative, but displays fusion in ot</span>ō<span lang=EN-US>to (</span>弟<span
lang=EN-US> younger brother), from oto+hito (originally woto+pito), and in its
non-affixing verb conjugations. A synthetic language may use morphological
agglutination combined with partial usage of fusional features, for example in
its case system (e.g., German, Dutch, and Persian).</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Agglutinative
languages tend to have a high rate of affixes or morphemes per word, and to be
very regular, in particular with very few irregular verbs. For example,
Japanese has very few irregular verbs </span><span style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>–<span
lang=EN-US> only two are significantly irregular, and there are only about a
dozen others with only minor irregularity; Ganda has only one (or two,
depending on how &quot;irregular&quot; is defined); while in the Quechua
languages, all the ordinary verbs are regular. In Turkish, there is only one
irregular noun (su, meaning water), no irregular verbs other than the copular
verbs, and two existential particles. Korean has only ten irregular forms of
conjugation. Georgian is an exception; it is highly agglutinative (with up to
eight morphemes per word), but it has a significant number of irregular verbs
with varying degrees of irregularity.</span></span></p>
