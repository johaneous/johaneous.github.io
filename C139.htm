the action of debt, may be maintained upon a single bill for a sum certain.

contract under seal usually imports a consideration; but when the performance
of the consideration constitutes a condition precedent, such performance must
be averred. So much only of the deed and covenant should be set forth as is
essential to the cause of action: although it is usual to declare in the words
of the deed, each covenant may be stated as to its legal effect. The breach may
be in the negative of the covenant generally 4 Dall. R. 436; or, according to
the legal effect, and sometimes in the alternative and several breaches may be assigned

1 Common Bench Rep. 402; co. Lit. 139, b; Vaughan's Rep. 118; Rawle on

express covenant, yet being made use of in certain contracts, have a similar
operation and are called covenants in law. They are as effectually binding on
the parties as if expressed in the most unequivocal terms. Bac. Ab. Covenant,
B. A few examples will fully explain this. If a lessor demise and grant to his
lessee a house or lands for a certain term, the law will imply a covenant on
the part of the lessor, that the lessee shall during the term quietly enjoy the
same against all incumbrances. Co. Litt. 384. When in a lease the words

affirmative and negative. 1st. An affirmative covenant is one by which the
covenantor binds himself that something has already been done or shall be
performed hereafter. Such a covenant will not deprive a man of a right lawfully
enjoyed by him independently of the covenant; 5 as, if the lessor agreed with
the lessee that he shall have thorns for hedges growing upon the land, by
assignment of the lessor's bailiff; here no restraint is imposed upon the
exercise of that liberty which the law allows to the lessee, and therefore he

is one where the party binds himself that he has not performed and will not
perform a certain act; as, that he will not encumber. Such a covenant cannot be
said to be performed until it becomes impossible to break it. On this ground
the courts are unwilling to construe a covenant of this kind to be a condition
precedent. Therefore, where a tailor assigned his trade to the defendant, and
covenanted thenceforth to desist from carrying on the said business with any of
the customers, and the defendant in consideration of the performance thereof, covenanted
to pay him a life annuity of 190, it was held that if the words &quot;in
consideration of the performance thereof,&quot; should be deemed to amount to a
condition precedent, the plaintiff would never obtain his annuity; because as
at anytime during his life he might exercise his former trade, until his death
it could never be ascertained whether he had performed the covenant or not. 2
Saund. 156; 1 Sid. 464; 1 Mod. 64; 2 Keb. 674. The defendant, however, on a
breach by plaintiff, might have his remedy by a cross action ofcovenant. There
is also a difference between a negative covenant, which is only in affirmance
of an affirmative covenant precedent, and a negative covenant which is
additional to the affirmative covenant. 1 Sid. 87; 1 Keb. 334, 372. To a
covenant of the former class a plea of performance generally is good, but not
to the latter; the defendant in that case must plead specially. Id.</span></p>
