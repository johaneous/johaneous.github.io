<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Note:
The term is applied to a seizure or taking either of persons or property. In
the serving of process in a civil suit, it is most generally applied to the
taking of property, whether at common law, as a species of distress, to compel
defendant's appearance, or under local statutes, to satisfy the judgment the
plaintiff may recover in the action. The terms attachment and arrest are both
applied to the taking or apprehension of a defendant to compel an appearance in
a civil action. Attachments are issued at common law and in chancery, against
persons for contempt of court. In England, attachment is employed in some cases
where capias is with us, as against a witness who fails to appear on summons.
In some of the New England States a writ of attachment is a species of mesne
process upon which the property of a defendant may be seized at the
commencement of a suit and before summons to him, and may be held to satisfy
the judgment the plaintiff may recover. In other States this writ can issue
only against absconding debtors and those who conceal themselves. See

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Usage:
The leading idea of affection is that of warmth and tenderness; the leading
idea of attachment is that of being bound to some object by strong and lasting
ties. There is more of sentiment (and sometimes of romance) in affection, and
more of principle in preserving attachment. We speak of the ardor of the one,
and the fidelity of the other. There is another distinction in the use and
application of these words. The term attachment is applied to a wider range of
objects than affection. A man may have a strong attachment to his country, to
his profession, to his principles, and even to favorite places; in respect to
none of these could we use the word affection.</span></p>

There are two kinds of attachment in Pennsylvania, the foreign attachment, and
the domestic attachment. l. The foreign attachment is a mode of proceeding by a
creditor against the property of his debtor, when the debtor is out of the
jurisdiction of the state, and is not an inhabitant of the same. The object of
this process is in the first instance to compel an appearance by the debtor,
although his property may even eventually be made liable to the amount of the
plaintiff Is claim. It will be proper to consider, 1. by whom it be issued; 2.
against what property 3. mode of proceeding. 1. The plaintiff must be a
creditor of the defendant; the claim of the plaintiff need not, however, be
technically a debt, but it may be such on which an action of assumpsit would
lie but an attachment will not lie for a demand which arises ex delicto; or
when special bail would not be regularly required. Serg. on Att. 51. 2. The
writ of attachment may be issued against the real and personal estate of any
person not residing within the commonwealth, and not being within the county in
which such writ may issue, at the time. of the issuing thereof. And proceedings
may be had against persons convicted of crime, and sentenced to imprisonment.
3. The writ of attachment is in general terms, not specifying in the body of it
the name of the garnishee, or the property to be attached, but commanding the
officer to attach the defendant, by all and singular his goods and chattels, in
whose hands or possession soever the same may be found in his bailiwick, so
that he be and appear before the court at a certain time to answer, &amp;c. The
foreign attachment is issued solely for the benefit of the plaintiff.</span></p>

domestic attachment is issued by the court of common pleas of the county in
which any debtor, being an inhabitant of the commonwealth, may reside; if such
debtor shall have absconded from the place of his usual abode within the same,
or shall have remained absent from the commonwealth, or shall have confined
himself to his own house, or concealed himself elsewhere, with a design, in
either case, to defraud his creditors. It is issued on an oath or affirmation,
previously made by a creditor of such person, or by some one on his behalf, of
the truth of his debt, and of the facts upon which the attachment may be
founded. Any other creditor of such person, upon affidavit of his debt as
aforesaid, may suggest his name upon the record, and thereupon such creditor
may proceed to prosecute his said writ, if the person suing the same shall
refuse or neglect to proceed thereon, or if he fail to establish his right to
prosecute the same, as a creditor of the defendant. The property attached is
vested in trustees to be appointed by the court, who are, after&nbsp; giving
six months public notice of their appointment, to distribute the assets
attached among the creditors under certain regulations prescribed by the act of
assembly. Perishable goods way be sold under an order of the court, both under

the code of practice of Louisiana, an attachment in the hands of third person
is declared to be a mandate which a creditor obtains from a competent officer,
commanding the seizure of any property, credit or right, belonging to his
debtor, in whatever hands they may be found, to satisfy the demand which he
intends to bring against him. A creditor may obtain such attachment of the
property of his debtor, in the following cases. 1. When such debtor is about
permanently leaving the state, without there being a possibility, in the
ordinary course of judicial proceedings, of obtaining or executing judgment
against him previous to, his departure; or when such debtor has already left
the state never again to return. 2. When such debtor resides out of the state.
3. When he conceals himself to avoid being cited or forced to answer to the
suit intended to be brought against him. Articles 239, 240.</span></p>

the local laws of some of the New England states, and particularly of the
states of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine, personal property and real
estate may be attached upon mesne process to respond the exigency of the writ,

officer to bail the goods attached, to some person, who is usually a friend of
the debtor, upon an express or implied agreement on his part, to have them
forthcoming on demand, or in time to respond the judgment, when the execution
