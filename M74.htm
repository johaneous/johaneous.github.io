of a covenant; 1 Watts, R. 140; with a proviso, that such conveyance shall be
void on payment of the money and interest on a certain day, or the performance
of such covenant by the time appointed, by which the conveyance of the land
becomes absolute at law, yet the, mortgagor has an equity of redemption, that

But it may be observed in general, that whatever clauses or covenants there are
in a conveyance, though they seem to import an absolute disposition or
conditional purchase, yet if, upon the whole, it appears to have been the
intention of the parties that such conveyance should be a mortgage only, or
pass an estate redeemable, a court of equity will always so construe it. Vern.

mortgage is seldom paid on the day appointed, mortgages have now become
entirely subject to the court of chancery, where it is an established rule that

title deeds, and a verbal agreement, will have the same effect of creating an
equitable mortgage. 1 Rawle, Rep. 328; 5 Wheat. R. 284; 1 Cox's Rep. 211. But
in Pennsylvania there is no such a thing as an equitable mortgage. 3 P. S. R.
233. Such an agreement will be carried into execution in equity against the

distinguishable from a mere pawn. 5 Verm. 532; 9 Wend. 80; 8 John. 96. By a
grant or conveyance of goods in gage or mortgage, the whole legal title passes
conditionally to the mortgagee, and if not redeemed at the time stipulated, the
title becomes absolute at law, though equity will interfere to compel a
redemption. But, in a pledge, a special property only passes to the pledgee,
the general property remaining in the pledger. There have been some cases of
mortgages of chattels, which have been held valid without any actual possession
in the mortgagee; but they stand upon very peculiar grounds and may be deemed
exceptions to the general rule. 2 Pick. R. 607; 5 Pick. R. 59; 5 Johns. R. 261;

a conditional sale with the right to repurchase very nearly resembles a mortgage;
but they are distinguishable. It is said that if the debt remains, the
transaction is a mortgage, but if the debt is extinguished by mutual agreement,

in a given time, and have a reconveyance, this is a conditional sale. 2 Edw. R.

47:27), and extended to the west and south. At length the supremacy of the
Hyksos came to an end. The descendants of Jacob were allowed to retain their
possession of Goshen undisturbed, but after the death of Joseph their position
was not so favourable. The Egyptians began to despise them, and the period of
their &quot;affliction&quot; (Gen. 15:13) commenced. They were sorely
oppressed. They continued, however, to increase in numbers, and &quot;the land
was filled with them&quot; (Ex. 1:7). The native Egyptians regarded them with
suspicion, so that they felt all the hardship of a struggle for existence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>In
process of time &quot;a king [probably Seti I.] arose who knew not Joseph&quot;
(Ex. 1:8). (See PHARAOH.) The circumstances of the country were such that this
king thought it necessary to weaken his Israelite subjects by oppressing them,</span><span
lang=EN-US> </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>and by
degrees reducing their number. They were accordingly made public slaves, and
were employed in connection with his numerous buildings, especially in the
erection of store-cities, temples, and palaces. The children of Israel were
made to serve with rigour. Their lives were made bitter with hard bondage, and
&quot;all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour&quot;
(Ex. 1:13, 14). But this cruel oppression had not the result expected of
reducing their number. On the contrary, &quot;the more the Egyptians afflicted
them, the more they multiplied and grew&quot; (Ex. 1:12).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>The king
next tried, through a compact secretly made with the guild of midwives, to
bring about the destruction of all the Hebrew male children that might be born.
But the king's wish was not rigorously enforced; the male children were spared
by the midwives, so that &quot;the people multiplied&quot; more than ever. Thus
baffled, the king issued a public proclamation calling on the people to put to
death all the Hebrew male children by casting them into the river (Ex. 1:22).
But neither by this edict was the king's purpose effected.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>One of
the Hebrew households into which this cruel edict of the king brought great
alarm was that of Amram, of the family of the Kohathites (Ex. 6:16-20), who
with his wife Jochebed and two children, Miriam, a girl of perhaps fifteen
years of age, and Aaron, a boy of three years, resided in or near Memphis, the
capital city of that time. In this quiet home a male child was born (B.C.
1571). His mother concealed him in the house for three months from the
knowledge of the civic authorities. But when the task of concealment became
difficult, Jochebed contrived to bring her child under the notice of the
daughter of the king by constructing for him an ark of bulrushes, which she
laid among the flags which grew on the edge of the river at the spot where the
princess was wont to come down and bathe. Her plan was successful. The king's
daughter &quot;saw the child; and behold the child wept.&quot; The princess
(see PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>�</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>T0002924 [1]) sent Miriam, who
was standing by, to fetch a nurse. She went and brought the mother of the
child, to whom the princess said, &quot;Take this child away, and nurse it for
me, and I will give thee thy wages.&quot; Thus Jochebed's child, whom the
princess called &quot;Moses&quot;, i.e., &quot;Saved from the water&quot; (Ex.
2:10), was ultimately restored to her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>As soon
as the natural time for weaning the child had come, he was transferred from the
humble abode of his father to the royal palace, where he was brought up as the
adopted son of the princess, his mother probably accompanying him and caring
still for him. He grew up amid all the grandeur and excitement of the Egyptian
court, maintaining, however, probably a constant fellowship with his mother,
which was of the highest importance as to his religious belief and his interest
in his &quot;brethren.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>His
education would doubtless be carefully attended to, and he would enjoy all the
advantages of training both as to his body and his mind. He at length became
&quot;learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians&quot; (Acts 7:22). Egypt had
then two chief seats of learning, or universities, at one of which, probably
that of Heliopolis, his education was completed. Moses, being now about twenty
years of age, spent over twenty more before he came into prominence in Bible
history. These twenty years were probably spent in military service. There is a
tradition recorded by Josephus that he took a lead in the war which was then
waged between Egypt and Ethiopia, in which he gained renown as a skilful
general, and became &quot;mighty in deeds&quot; (Acts 7:22).<br>
After the termination of the war in Ethiopia, Moses returned to the Egyptian
court, where he might reasonably have expected to be loaded with honours and
enriched with wealth. But &quot;beneath the smooth current of his life
hitherto, a life of alternate luxury at the court and comparative hardness in
the camp and in the discharge of his military duties, there had lurked from
childhood to youth, and from youth to manhood, a secret discontent, perhaps a
secret ambition. Moses, amid all his Egyptian surroundings, had never
forgotten, had never wished to forget, that he was a Hebrew.&quot; He now
resolved to make himself acquainted with the condition of his countrymen, and
&quot;went out unto his brethren, and looked upon their burdens&quot; (Ex.
2:11).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>This
tour of inspection revealed to him the cruel oppression and bondage under which
they everywhere groaned, and could not fail to press on him the serious
consideration of his duty regarding them. The time had arrived for his making
common cause with them, that he might thereby help to break their yoke of
bondage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>He made
his choice accordingly (Heb. 11:25-27), assured that God</span><span
lang=EN-US> </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>would
bless his resolution for the welfare of his people. He now left the palace of
the king and took up his abode, probably in his father's house, as one of the
Hebrew people who had for forty years been suffering cruel wrong at the hands
of the Egyptians.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>He could
not remain indifferent to the state of things around him, and going out one day
among the people, his indignation was roused against an Egyptian who was
maltreating a Hebrew. He rashly lifted up his hand and slew the Egyptian, and
hid his body in the sand. Next day he went out again and found two Hebrews
striving together. He speedily found that the deed of the previous day was
known. It reached the ears of Pharaoh (the &quot;great Rameses,&quot; Rameses
II.), who &quot;sought to slay Moses&quot; (Ex. 2:15). Moved by fear, Moses
fled from Egypt, and betook himself to the land of Midian, the southern part of
the peninsula of Sinai, probably by much the same route as that by which, forty
years afterwards, he led the Israelites to Sinai. He was providentially led to
find a new home with the family of Reuel, where he remained for forty years
(Acts 7:30), under training unconsciously for his great life's work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Suddenly
the angel of the Lord appeared to him in the burning bush (Ex. 3), and
commissioned him to go down to Egypt and &quot;bring forth the children of
Israel&quot; out of bondage. He was at first unwilling to go, but at length he
was obedient to the heavenly vision, and left the land of Midian (4:18-26). On
the way he was met by Aaron (q.v.) and the elders of Israel (27-31). He and
Aaron had a hard task before them; but the Lord was with them (ch. 7-12), and
the ransomed host went forth in triumph. (See EXODUS.) After an eventful
journey to and fro in the wilderness, we see them at length encamped in the
plains of Moab, ready to cross over the Jordan into the Promised Land. There
Moses addressed the assembled elders (Deut. 1:1-4; 5:1-26:19; 27:11-30:20), and
gives the people his last counsels, and then rehearses the great song (Deut.
32), clothing in fitting words the deep emotions of his heart at such a time,
and in review of such a marvellous history as that in which he had acted so
conspicious a part. Then, after blessing the tribes (33), he ascends to
&quot;the mountain of Nebo (q.v.), to the top of Pisgah, that is over against
Jericho&quot; (34:1), and from thence he surveys the land. &quot;Jehovah shewed
him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, and all Naphtali, and the land of
Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea, and the
south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto
Zoar&quot; (Deut. 34:2-3), the magnificient inheritance of the tribes of whom
he had been so long the leader; and there he died, being one hundred and twenty
years old, according to the word of the Lord, and was buried by the Lord
&quot;in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor&quot; (34:6). The
people mourned for him during thirty days.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Thus
died &quot;Moses the man of God&quot; (Deut. 33:1; Josh. 14:6). He was
distinguished for his meekness and patience and firmness, and &quot;he endured
as seeing him who is invisible.&quot; &quot;There arose not a prophet since in
Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face, in all the signs and
the wonders, which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and
to all his servants, and to all his land, and in all that mighty hand, and in
all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel&quot; (Deut.
