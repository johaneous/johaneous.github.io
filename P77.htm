another division; they are either to the jurisdiction of the court, in

the first three of which belong to the dilatory class, the last is of the
peremptory kind. Steph. Pl. 63; 1 Chit. Pl. 425; Lawes, Pl. 36.</span></p>

and settled the order of pleading, which the defendant is to pursue, to wit;
1st. To the jurisdiction of the court. 2d. To the disability, &amp;c. of the
person. 1st. Of the plaintiff. 2d. Of the defendant. 3d. To the count or
declaration. 4th. To the writ. 1st. To the form of the writ; first, Matter

natural order of pleading, because each subsequent, plea admits that there is
no foundation for the former. Such is the English law. 1 Ch. Plead. 425. The
rule is different with regard to the plea of jurisdiction in the courts of the
United States and those of Pennsylvania. 1. Binn. 138; ld. 219; 2 Dall. 368; 3
Dall. 19; 10 S. &amp; R. 229.</span></p>

sense, means suit or action, and it is sometimes still used in that sense; for
example, A B was summoned to answer C D of a plea that he render, &amp;c.
Steph. Pl. 38, 39, u. 9; Warr. Law Studies, 272, note n.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Plea</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">, () 8.-3. This variable word, to
plead, has still another and more popular use, importing forensic argument in a
cause, but it is not so employed by the profession. Steph. Pl. App. note 1.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Plea</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">, () 9. There are various sorts
of pleas, the principal of which are given below.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Plea</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">, () 10. Plea in abatement, is
when, for any default, the defendant prays that the writ or plaint do abate,
that is, cease against him for that time. Com. Dig. Abatement, B. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Plea</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">, () 11. Hence it may be
observed, 1st. That the defendant may plead in Abatement for faults apparent on
the writ or plaint itself, or for such as are shown dehors, or out of the writ
or plaint. 2d. That a plea in, abatement is never perpetual, but only a
temporary plea, in form at least, and if the cause revived, the plaintiff may
sue again.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Plea</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">, () 12. If the defendant plead a
plea in abatement, in his plea, he ought generally to give a better writ to the
plaintiff, that is, show him what other and better writ can be adopted; Com.
Dig. Abatement, I 1; but if the plea go to the matter and substance of the
writ, &amp;c., he need not give the plaintiff another writ. Nor need he do so
when the plea avoids the whole cause of the action. Id. I 2.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Plea</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">, () 13. Pleas in abatement are
divided into those relating, first, to the disability of the plaintiff or
defendant; secondly, to the count or declaration; thirdly, to the writ. 1 Chit.
Pl. 435.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Plea</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">, () 14.-1. Plea in abatement to
the person of the plaintiff. Pleas of this kind are either that the plaintiff
is not in existence, being only a fictitious person, or dead; or else, that
being in existence, he is under some disability to bring or maintain the
action, as by being an alien enemy; Com. Dig. Abatement, E 4 Bac. Abr.
Abatement, B 3; 1 Chit. Pl. 436; or the plaintiff is a married woman, and she
sues alone. See 3 T. R. 631; 6 T. R. 265.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Plea</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">, () 15. Plea in abatement to the
person of the defendant. These pleas are coverture, and, in the English law,
infancy, when the parol shall demur. When a feme covert is sued, and the
objection is merely that the husband ought to have been sued jointly with her;
as when, since entering into the contract, or committing the tort, she has
married; she must, when sued alone, plead her coverture in abatement, and aver
that her husband is living. 3 T. R. 627; 1 Chit. Pl. 437, 8.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Plea</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">, () 16.-2. Plea in abatement to
the count. Pleas of this kind are for some uncertainty, repugnancy, or want of
form, not appearing on the face of the writ itself, but apparent from the
recital of it in the declaration only; or else for some variance between the
writ and declaration. But it was always necessary to obtain oyer of the writ
before the pleading of these pleas; and since oyer cannot now be had of the
original writ for the purpose of pleading them, it seems that they can no
longer be pleaded. See Oyer.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Plea</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">, () 17. Plea in abatement to the
form of the writ. Such pleas are for some apparent uncertainty, repugnancy, or
want of form, variance from the record, specialty, &amp;c., mentioned therein,
or misnomer of the plaintiff or defendant. Lawes' Civ. Pl. 106; 1 Chit. Pl.
440.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Plea</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">, () 18. Plea in abatement to the
action of the writ. Pleas of this kind are pleaded when the action is
misconceived, or was prematurely commenced before the cause of action arose; or
when there is another action depending for the same cause. Tidd's Pr. 579. But
as these matters are ground for demurrer or nonsuit, it is now very unusual to
plead them in abatement. See 2 Saund. 210, a.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Plea</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">, () 19. Plea in avoidance, is
one which confesses the matters contained in the declaration, and avoids the
effect of them, by some new matter which shows that the plaintiff is not
entitled to maintain his action. For example, the plea may admit the contract
declared upon, and show that it was void or voidable, because of the inability
of one of the parties to make it, on account of coverture, infancy, or the
like. Lawes, Pl. 122.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Plea</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">, () 20. Plea in bar, is one that
denies that the plaintiff has any cause of action. 1 Ch. Pl. 459 Co. Litt. 303
b; 6 Co. 7. Or it is one which shows some ground for barring or defeating the
action; and makes prayer to that effect, Steph. Pl. 70; Britton, 92. See Bar.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Plea</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">, () 21. A plea in bar is,
therefore, distinguished from all pleas of the dilatory class, as impugning the
right of the action altogether, instead of merely tending to divert the
proceedings to another jurisdiction, or suspend them, or abate the particular
writ. It is in short a substantial and conclusive answer to the action. It
follows, from this property, that in general, it must either deny all, or some
essential part of the averments of fact in the declaration; or, admitting them
to be true, allege new facts, which obviate and repel their legal effect. In
the first case the defendant is said, in the language of pleading, to traverse
the matter of the declaration; in the latter, to confess and avoid it. Pleas in
bar are consequently divided into pleas by way of traverse, and pleas by way of
confession and avoidance. Steph. Pl. 70, 71.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Plea</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">, () 22. Pleas in bar are, also
divided into general or special. General pleas in bar deny or take issue either
upon the whole or part of the declaration, or contain some new matter which is
relied upon by the defendant in his defence. Lawes Pl. 110.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Plea</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">, () 23. Special pleas in bar are
very various, according to the circumstances of the defendant's case; as, in
personal actions, the defendant may plead any special matter in denial,
avoidance, discharge, excuse, or justification of the matter alleged in the
declaration, which destroys or bars the plaintiff's action; or he may plead any
matter which estops, or precludes him from averring or insisting on any matter
relied upon by the plaintiff in his declaration. The latter sort of pleas are called
pleas in estoppel. In real actions, the tenant may plead any matter which
destroys and bars the demandant's title; as, a general release. Id. 115, 116.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">Plea</span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;新細明體&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;" lang="EN-US">, () 24. The general qualities of
a plea in bar are, 1. That it be adapted to the nature and form of the action,
and also conformable to the count. Co. Litt. 303, a 285, b; Bac. Abr. Pleas, I;
1 Roll. Rep. 216.</span></p>

assumes to answer, and no more. Co. Litt. 303 a; Com. Dig. Pleader, E 1, 36; 1

divided by Sir William Blackstone, into three kinds: 1. Pleas to the
jurisdiction of the court; as, that the cause of action arose out of the limits
of the jurisdiction of the court, when the action is local. 2. Pleas to the
disability of the plaintiff, or, as they are usually termed, to' the person of
the plaintiff; as, that he is an alien enemy. 3. Pleas in abatement of the
writ, or count; these are founded upon some defect or mistake, either in the
writ itself; as, that the defendant is misnamed in it, or the like; or in the
mode in which the count pursues it; as, that there is some variance or
repugnancy between the count and writ; in which case, the fault in the count
furnishes a cause for abating the writ. 2 Bl. Com. 301 Com. Dig. Abatement, G

sometimes called pleas in abatement, as contradistinguished to pleas to the
action; this is perhaps not strictly proper, because, though all pleas in
abatement are dilatory pleas, yet all dilatory pleas are not pleas in abatement.
Gould on Pl. ch. 2, Sec. 35; vide 1 Chit. PI, ch. 6; Bac. Ab. Abatement, 0; 1
Mass 358; 1 John. Cas. 101. 2. A plea in discharge, as distinguish ed from a
plea in avoidance, is one which admits the demand, and instead of avoiding the
payment or satisfaction of it, shows that it has been discharged by some matter
of fact. Such are pleas of payment, release, and the like.</span></p>

which admits the demand or complaint stated in the declaration, but excuses the
non-compliance of the plaintiff's claim, or the commission of the act of which
he complains, on account of the defendant having done all in his power to
satisfy the former, or not having teen the culpable author of the latter. A
plea of tender is an example of the former, and a plea of son assault demesne,
an instance of the latter.</span></p>

which takes the cause out of the court where it is pleaded, by showing a want

is one in which the defendant professes purposely to have done the acts which
are the subject of the plaintiff's suit, in order to exercise that right which
he considers he might in point of law exercise, and in the exercise of which he
conceives himself not merely excused, but justified.</span></p>

continuance. Under the ancient law, there were continuances, i. e. adjournments
of the proceedings for certain purposes, from one day or one term to another;
and, in such cases, there was an entry made on the record, expressing the
ground of the adjournment, and appointing the parties to reappear at a given
day.</span></p>

such continuance and the day appointed, the parties were of course out of
court, and consequently not in a situation to plead. But it sometimes happened,
that after a plea had been pleaded, and while the parties were out of court, in
consequence of such continuance, a new matter of defence arose, which did not
exist, and which the defendant had consequently no opportunity to plead, before
the last continuance. This new defence he was therefore entitled, at the day
given for his reappearance, to plead as a matter that had happened after the
last continuance, puis darrein continuance. In the same cases that occasioned a
continuance in the ancient common law, but in no other, a continuance shall take
place. At the time indeed, when the pleadings are filed and delivered, no
record exists, and there is, therefore, no entry at that time, made on the
record, of the award of a continuance; but the parties are, from the day when,
by the ancient practice, a continuance would have been entered, supposed to be
out of court, and the pleading is suspended, till the day arrives to which, by
the ancient, practice, the continuance would extend. At that day, the defendant
is entitled, if any new matter of defence has arisen in the interval, to plead
it according to the ancient plan, puis darrein continuance.</span></p>

continuance is not a departure from, but is a waiver of the first plea, and is
always headed by way of substitution for it, on which no proceeding is
afterwards had. 1 Salk. 178; 2 Stran. 1195 Hob. 81; 4 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 239.

is known to the pleader to be false, and is entered for the purpose of delay.
There are certain pleas of this kind, which, in consequence of their having
been long and frequently used in practice, have obtained toleration from the
courts; and, though discouraged, are tacitly allowed; as, for example, the
common plea of judgment recovered, that is, that judgment has been already
recovered by the plaintiff, for the same cause of action. Steph. on Pleading, 444,

the action. Such a plea is one which shows some ground for not proceeding in
the suit at the present period, and prays that the pleading may be stayed,
until that ground be removed. The number of these pleas is small. Among them is
that which is founded on the nonage of the parties, and termed parol demurrer.

plea," says Lord Bacon, speaking of proceedings in courts of equity,
"is a foreign matter to discharge or stay the suit." Ord. Chan. (ed.
Beam.) p. 26. Lord Redesdale defines it to be "a special answer showing or
relying upon one or more things as a cause why the suit should be either
dismissed, delayed or barred." Mitf. Tr. Ch. 177; see Coop. Eq. Pl. 223;
Beames' Pl. Eq. 1. A plea is a special answer to a bill, and differs in this
from an answer in the common form, as it demands the judgment of the court in
the first instance, whether the matter urged by it does not debar the plaintiff
from his title to that answer which the bill requires. 2&nbsp; Sch. &amp; Lef. 721.</span></p>
