<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>, () There are various sorts of

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>, () Plea in abatement, is when,
for any default, the defendant prays that the writ or plaint do abate, that is,
cease against him for that time. Com. Dig. Abatement, B.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span

1st. That the defendant may plead in Abatement for faults apparent on the writ
or plaint itself, or for such as are shown dehors, or out of the writ or
plaint. 2d. That a plea in, abatement is never perpetual, but only a temporary
plea, in form at least, and if the cause revived, the plaintiff may sue again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>, () If the defendant plead a
plea in abatement, in his plea, he ought generally to give a better writ to the
plaintiff, that is, show him what other and better writ can be adopted; Com.
Dig. Abatement, I 1; but if the plea go to the matter and substance of the
writ, &amp;c., he need not give the plaintiff another writ. Nor need he do so
when the plea avoids the whole cause of the action. Id. I 2.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>, () Pleas in abatement are
divided into those relating, first, to the disability of the plaintiff or
defendant; secondly, to the count or declaration; thirdly, to the writ. 1 Chit.
Pl. 435.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>, () Plea in abatement to the
person of the plaintiff. Pleas of this kind are either that the plaintiff is
not in existence, being only a fictitious person, or dead; or else, that being
in existence, he is under some disability to bring or maintain the action, as
by being an alien enemy; Com. Dig. Abatement, E 4 Bac. Abr. Abatement, B 3; 1
Chit. Pl. 436; or the plaintiff is a married woman, and she sues alone. See 3
T. R. 631; 6 T. R. 265.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>, () Plea in abatement to the
person of the defendant. These pleas are coverture, and, in the English law,
infancy, when the parol shall demur. When a feme covert is sued, and the
objection is merely that the husband ought to have been sued jointly with her;
as when, since entering into the contract, or committing the tort, she has
married; she must, when sued alone, plead her coverture in abatement, and aver
that her husband is living. 3 T. R. 627; 1 Chit. Pl. 437, 8.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>, () Plea in abatement to the
count. Pleas of this kind are for some uncertainty, repugnancy, or want of
form, not appearing on the face of the writ itself, but apparent from the
recital of it in the declaration only; or else for some variance between the
writ and declaration. But it was always necessary to obtain oyer of the writ
before the pleading of these pleas; and since oyer cannot now be had of the
original writ for the purpose of pleading them, it seems that they can no
longer be pleaded. See Oyer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>, () Plea in abatement to the
form of the writ. Such pleas are for some apparent uncertainty, repugnancy, or
want of form, variance from the record, specialty, &amp;c., mentioned therein,
or misnomer of the plaintiff or defendant. Lawes' Civ. Pl. 106; 1 Chit. Pl.
440.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>, () Plea in abatement to the
action of the writ. Pleas of this kind are pleaded when the action is
misconceived, or was prematurely commenced before the cause of action arose; or
when there is another action depending for the same cause. Tidd's Pr. 579. But
as these matters are ground for demurrer or nonsuit, it is now very unusual to
plead them in abatement. See 2 Saund. 210, a.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>, () Plea in avoidance, is one
which confesses the matters contained in the declaration, and avoids the effect
of them, by some new matter which shows that the plaintiff is not entitled to
maintain his action. For example, the plea may admit the contract declared
upon, and show that it was void or voidable, because of the inability of one of
the parties to make it, on account of coverture, infancy, or the like. Lawes,
Pl. 122.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>, () Plea in bar, is one that
denies that the plaintiff has any cause of action. 1 Ch. Pl. 459 Co. Litt. 303
b; 6 Co. 7. Or it is one which shows some ground for barring or defeating the
action; and makes prayer to that effect, Steph. Pl. 70; Britton, 92. See Bar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>, () A plea in bar is, therefore,
distinguished from all pleas of the dilatory class, as impugning the right of
the action altogether, instead of merely tending to divert the proceedings to another
jurisdiction, or suspend them, or abate the particular writ. It is in short a
substantial and conclusive answer to the action. It follows, from this
property, that in general, it must either deny all, or some essential part of
the averments of fact in the declaration; or, admitting them to be true, allege
new facts, which obviate and repel their legal effect. In the first case the
defendant is said, in the language of pleading, to traverse the matter of the
declaration; in the latter, to confess and avoid it. Pleas in bar are
consequently divided into pleas by way of traverse, and pleas by way of
confession and avoidance. Steph. Pl. 70, 71.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>, () Pleas in bar are, also
divided into general or special. General pleas in bar deny or take issue either
upon the whole or part of the declaration, or contain some new matter which is
relied upon by the defendant in his defence. Lawes Pl. 110.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>, () Special pleas in bar are
very various, according to the circumstances of the defendant's case; as, in
personal actions, the defendant may plead any special matter in denial,
avoidance, discharge, excuse, or justification of the matter alleged in the
declaration, which destroys or bars the plaintiff's action; or he may plead any
matter which estops, or precludes him from averring or insisting on any matter
relied upon by the plaintiff in his declaration. The latter sort of pleas are
called pleas in estoppel. In real actions, the tenant may plead any matter
which destroys and bars the demandant's title; as, a general release. Id. 115,
116.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>, () The general qualities of a
plea in bar are, 1. That it be adapted to the nature and form of the action,
and also conformable to the count. Co. Litt. 303, a 285, b; Bac. Abr. Pleas, I;
1 Roll. Rep. 216.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span

() Sir William Jones defines a pledge to be a bailment of goods by a debtor to
his creditor, to be kept till the debt is discharged. Jones' Bailm. 117; Id.
36. Chancellor Kent, 2 Kent's Com. 449, follows the same definition, and see 1
Dane's Abr. c. 17, art. 4. Pothier, De Nantissement, art. prelim. 1, defines it
to be a contract by which a debtor gives to his creditor a thing to detain as
security for his debt. The code Napoleon has adopted this definition, Code Civ.
art. 2071, and the Civil Code of Louisiana has followed it. Louis. Code, 3100.
Lord Holt's definition is, when goods or chattels are delivered to another as a
pawn, to be security for money borrowed of him by the bailor and this, he adds,
is called in Latin vadium, and in English, a pawn or pledge. Ld. Raym. 909,

() The foregoing definitions are sufficiently descriptive of the nature of a
pawn or pledge but they are in terms limited to cues where a thing is given as
a security for a debt; but a pawn may well be made as security for any other
engagement. 2 Bulst. 306; Pothier, De Nantissement, n. 11. The definition of
Domat is, therefore, more accurate, because it is more comprehensive, namely,
that it is an appropriation of the thing given for the security of an
engagement. Domat, B. 3, tit. 1, Sec. 1, n. 1. And, according to Judge Story,
it may be defined to be a bailment of personal property, as security for some
debt or engagement. Story on Bailm. Sec. 286.</span></p>

() A mortgage of goods is, in the common law, distinguishable from a mere pawn.
By a grant or a conveyance of goods in gage or mortgage, the whole legal title
passes conditionally to the mortgagee; and if not redeemed at the time
stipulated, the title becomes absolute at law, though equity will interfere to
compel a redemption. But in a pledge a special property only passes to the
pledges, the general property remaining in the pledger. 1 Atk. 167; 6 East, 25;

engagement. Such a default does not divest the general property of the pawner,
but still leaves him a right of redemption. But if the, pledge is not redeemed
within the stipulated time, by a due performance of the contract for which it
is a security, the pawnee has then a right to sell it, in order to have his
debt or indemnity. And if there is no stipulated time for the payment of the
debt, but the pledge is for an indefinite period, the pawnee has a right, upon
