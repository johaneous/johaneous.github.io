lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'> (<i>n</i>.) This is said to be
the natural order of pleading, because each subsequent, plea admits that there

rule is different with regard to the plea of jurisdiction in the courts of the
United States and those of Pennsylvania. 1. Binn. 138; ld. 219; 2 Dall. 368; 3

sense, means suit or action, and it is sometimes still used in that sense; for
example, A B was summoned to answer C D of a plea that he render, &amp;c.
Steph. Pl. 38, 39, u. 9; Warr. Law Studies, 272, note n.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'> (<i>n</i>.) There are various
sorts of pleas, the principal of which are given below.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'> (<i>n</i>.) Plea in abatement,
is when, for any default, the defendant prays that the writ or plaint do abate,
that is, cease against him for that time. Com. Dig. Abatement, B.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'> (<i>n</i>.) Hence it may be
observed, 1st. That the defendant may plead in Abatement for faults apparent on
the writ or plaint itself, or for such as are shown dehors, or out of the writ
or plaint. 2d. That a plea in, abatement is never perpetual, but only a
temporary plea, in form at least, and if the cause revived, the plaintiff may
sue again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'> (<i>n</i>.) If the defendant
plead a plea in abatement, in his plea, he ought generally to give a better
writ to the plaintiff, that is, show him what other and better writ can be
adopted; Com. Dig. Abatement, I 1; but if the plea go to the matter and
substance of the writ, &amp;c., he need not give the plaintiff another writ.
Nor need he do so when the plea avoids the whole cause of the action. Id. I 2.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'> (<i>n</i>.) Pleas in abatement
are divided into those relating, first, to the disability of the plaintiff or
defendant; secondly, to the count or declaration; thirdly, to the writ. 1 Chit.
Pl. 435.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'> (<i>n</i>.) Plea in abatement to
the person of the plaintiff. Pleas of this kind are either that the plaintiff
is not in existence, being only a fictitious person, or dead; or else, that
being in existence, he is under some disability to bring or maintain the
action, as by being an alien enemy; Com. Dig. Abatement, E 4 Bac. Abr.
Abatement, B 3; 1 Chit. Pl. 436; or the plaintiff is a married woman, and she
sues alone. See 3 T. R. 631; 6 T. R. 265.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'> (<i>n</i>.) Plea in abatement to
the person of the defendant. These pleas are coverture, and, in the English
law, infancy, when the parol shall demur. When a feme covert is sued, and the
objection is merely that the husband ought to have been sued jointly with her;
as when, since entering into the contract, or committing the tort, she has
married; she must, when sued alone, plead her coverture in abatement, and aver
that her husband is living. 3 T. R. 627; 1 Chit. Pl. 437, 8.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'> (<i>n</i>.) Plea in abatement to
the count. Pleas of this kind are for some uncertainty, repugnancy, or want of
form, not appearing on the face of the writ itself, but apparent from the
recital of it in the declaration only; or else for some variance between the
writ and declaration. But it was always necessary to obtain oyer of the writ
before the pleading of these pleas; and since oyer cannot now be had of the
original writ for the purpose of pleading them, it seems that they can no
longer be pleaded. See Oyer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'> (<i>n</i>.) Plea in abatement to
the form of the writ. Such pleas are for some apparent uncertainty, repugnancy,
or want of form, variance from the record, specialty, &amp;c., mentioned
therein, or misnomer of the plaintiff or defendant. Lawes' Civ. Pl. 106; 1
Chit. Pl. 440.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'> (<i>n</i>.) Plea in abatement to
the action of the writ. Pleas of this kind are pleaded when the action is
misconceived, or was prematurely commenced before the cause of action arose; or
when there is another action depending for the same cause. Tidd's Pr. 579. But
as these matters are ground for demurrer or nonsuit, it is now very unusual to
plead them in abatement. See 2 Saund. 210, a.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'> (<i>n</i>.) Plea in avoidance,
is one which confesses the matters contained in the declaration, and avoids the
effect of them, by some new matter which shows that the plaintiff is not
entitled to maintain his action. For example, the plea may admit the contract
declared upon, and show that it was void or voidable, because of the inability
of one of the parties to make it, on account of coverture, infancy, or the like.
Lawes, Pl. 122.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'> (<i>n</i>.) Plea in bar, is one
that denies that the plaintiff has any cause of action. 1 Ch. Pl. 459 Co. Litt.
303 b; 6 Co. 7. Or it is one which shows some ground for barring or defeating
the action; and makes prayer to that effect, Steph. Pl. 70; Britton, 92. See
Bar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'> (<i>n</i>.) A plea in bar is,
therefore, distinguished from all pleas of the dilatory class, as impugning the
right of the action altogether, instead of merely tending to divert the
proceedings to another jurisdiction, or suspend them, or abate the particular
writ. It is in short a substantial and conclusive answer to the action. It
follows, from this property, that in general, it must either deny all, or some
essential part of the averments of fact in the declaration; or, admitting them
to be true, allege new facts, which obviate and repel their legal effect. In
the first case the defendant is said, in the language of pleading, to traverse
the matter of the declaration; in the latter, to confess and avoid it. Pleas in
bar are consequently divided into pleas by way of traverse, and pleas by way of
confession and avoidance. Steph. Pl. 70, 71.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'> (<i>n</i>.) Pleas in bar are,
also divided into general or special. General pleas in bar deny or take issue either
upon the whole or part of the declaration, or contain some new matter which is
relied upon by the defendant in his defence. Lawes Pl. 110.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'> (<i>n</i>.) Special pleas in bar
are very various, according to the circumstances of the defendant's case; as,
in personal actions, the defendant may plead any special matter in denial,
avoidance, discharge, excuse, or justification of the matter alleged in the
declaration, which destroys or bars the plaintiff's action; or he may plead any
matter which estops, or precludes him from averring or insisting on any matter
relied upon by the plaintiff in his declaration. The latter sort of pleas are
called pleas in estoppel. In real actions, the tenant may plead any matter
which destroys and bars the demandant's title; as, a general release. Id. 115,
116.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'> (<i>n</i>.) The general
qualities of a plea in bar are, 1. That it be adapted to the nature and form of
the action, and also conformable to the count. Co. Litt. 303, a 285, b; Bac.
Abr. Pleas, I; 1 Roll. Rep. 216.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Plea</span></b><span

disability of the plaintiff, or, as they are usually termed, to' the person of
the plaintiff; as, that he is an alien enemy. 3. Pleas in abatement of the
writ, or count; these are founded upon some defect or mistake, either in the
writ itself; as, that the defendant is misnamed in it, or the like; or in the
mode in which the count pursues it; as, that there is some variance or
repugnancy between the count and writ; in which case, the fault in the count
furnishes a cause for abating the writ. 2 Bl. Com. 301 Com. Dig. Abatement, G

did not exist, and which the defendant had consequently no opportunity to

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"新細明體","serif"'>Usage:
Pleasant, Pleasing, Agreeable. Agreeable is applied to that which agrees with,
or is in harmony with, one's tastes, character, etc. Pleasant and pleasing
denote a stronger degree of the agreeable. Pleasant refers rather to the state
or condition; pleasing, to the act or effect. Where they are applied to the
same object, pleasing is more energetic than pleasant; as, she is always pleasant
and always pleasing. The distinction, however, is not radical and not rightly
observed.</span></p>

Chancellor Kent, 2 Kent's Com. 449, follows the same definition, and see 1

security for his debt. The code Napoleon has adopted this definition, Code Civ.

Lord Holt's definition is, when goods or chattels are delivered to another as a
pawn, to be security for money borrowed of him by the bailor and this, he adds,
is called in Latin vadium, and in English, a pawn or pledge. Ld. Raym. 909,

definitions are sufficiently descriptive of the nature of a pawn or pledge but
they are in terms limited to cues where a thing is given as a security for a

Bulst. 306; Pothier, De Nantissement, n. 11. The definition of Domat is,
therefore, more accurate, because it is more comprehensive, namely, that it is
an appropriation of the thing given for the security of an engagement. Domat,

Such a default does not divest the general property of the pawner, but still
